Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.

Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.

Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.

reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.

Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."

Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.

Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need

use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?

Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.

as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.

Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.

Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?

Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.

descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.

Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!

Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.

Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.

Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.

Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.

Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!

Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.

Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.

Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM

Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?

Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.

Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
%
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
%
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?
%
(Sheldon repeatedly knocking and saying Leonard's name)
Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!
%
Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to
www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events,
scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it
made sense to you or not.
%
Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
%
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.
%
Sheldon: Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.
%
Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a
napkin, homey, you just got served.
Leonard: That's fine, you win. (walks away)  
Howard (to Sheldon): What's his problem?  
Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard: Been there!
%
Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.
%
Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.
%
Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
%
Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
%
Leonard: You're going march yourself over there right now and apologize
(to Penny)!
Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: Uuuuuuh. Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
%
Sheldon: (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I
should not have to do this.
%
Penny: SON OF A BITCH!!
Leonard: Penny's up
Penny: YOU SICK GEEKY BASTARDS!
Leonard: How did she know it was us?
Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her
bedroom closet.
Penny: LEONARD!
Leonard: God this is going to be bad.
Sheldon: Good bye honey puffs...helloo big bran.
%
Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.
Sheldon: You don't think that crosses the line?
Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
%
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.

Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
%
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
%
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
%
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
%
Leonard: You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon: No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Sheldon: Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
%
Leonard: (Watching their fight on YouTube) Oh, geez, does this suit really
look that bad?
Sheldon: Forget your suit. Look at my arms flailing. I'm like a flamingo
on Ritalin.
%
(At the mailboxes).
Penny: Get anything good?
Sheldon: Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
Penny: Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't!
%
Leonard: Are there any other honors that I've gotten that I don't know
about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon: Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you
win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient
of tassles on flying carpets.
%
Sheldon: If I'm not taking credit for our work, then nobody is!
Leonard: So, you admit that it's our work!
Sheldon: No, once again I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are
welcome.
Howard: Oh no he didn't!
%
Leonard: A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there%u2019s this
farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won%u2019t lay any eggs. So,
he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations,
and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum.
%
Leonard: You cannot blow up my head with your brain.
Sheldon: Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
%
Leonard: Forget the parties.
Howard: Forget the parties!? What a nerd!
%
Howard: (Acting like a diva) Oh, no he didn't!
%
Leonard: Is this the stuff you want me to try on?
Penny: No this is the stuff I want you to throw out. Seriously, don't even
give it to charity. You won't be helping anyone.
%
Leonard: Kandor was the Capital city of the planet, Krypton. It was
miniaturized by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by
Superman.
Penny: Oh, nice!
Leonard: It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
%
Penny: I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that
without your little idea, there was no way he could've come up with this
whole experiment thing.
Sheldon: (Insulted) Excuse me, little idea?
Penny: Yeah, he tried to explain it to me. I didn't really understand it--
Sheldon: Of course, you didn't. He said "Little Idea"?
Penny:Oh, well, no. I mean, not in those words--
Sheldon:In which words, then, exactly?
Penny: Oh, well, geez, it's not the words, it's more the spirit in which--
Sheldon:What did he say?
Penny: (Straightforward) You had a lucky hunch.
Leonard: (Exiting Apartment) Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, Instead of
arguing about this, why--
Sheldon: Don't you ever speak to me again.
%
Leonard: Okay, I'm going ask you one more time, we did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
Sheldon: And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's
undignified, and bite me.
%
Penny: Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has
a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned: "Me and My
Girlfriend"?
Howard: Uh oh, here comes "The Talk"!
*Penny tries to blow up Howard's head.*
%
Howard: Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop
through our local ISP racing down fiber optic cable at the of light to San
Francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon,
Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged
transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transferred
across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the external
receiver attached to this...(lamp turns on automatically) lamp.
%
Sheldon: (After witnessing Howard's project) Look at me, look at me, I've
got goose bumps.
%
Howard: The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is
being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
Sheldon: (looking at laptop) You may want to put on slacks.
Penny: What? (Grossed out) Eww! Stop it! No! Leave me alone. (Running off)
Leonard:Who's running the red Corvette?
Howard:T hat would be me!
%
Penny: What is this?
Leonard: Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica
flight suit.
Penny: Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Leonard: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
%
Raj: She didn't even get to see my penis.
%
Amy: Try not to ogle my kaboose as I walk away.
%
Sheldon: There's no need to interact with me. I'm just here to observe.
%
Sheldon: As a mental exercise, I invite you to figure out why the two of
us can't play three-person chess.
%
(Contemplating a pair of shoes)
Penny: Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my
womb out to a gay couple.
%
Rajesh: Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.
%
(To a box of expensive shoes she's about to take back)
Penny: I'm sorry, shoes, but you have to go back.
Shoebox (Penny): But, Penny, we love you.
Penny: I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent.
Shoebox (Penny): But Penny, you look so good in us.
Penny: (To Amy) Damn it, the shoes are right!
%
Wolowitz: Have you ever been told you're beautiful in flawless Russian?
Penny: No.
Wolowitz: Well get used to it.
%
Sheldon: Oh! Ouch ouch! My metatarsals are barking!
%
Sheldon: Good Morning your honor, Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se -
that is to say representing himself.
Judge: I know what it means, I went to law school.
Sheldon: Yet you wound up in traffic court.
%
Sheldon: *Knocking on Penny's door* Penny... Penny...
Penny: *Opening her door and knocking on it herself* ...Penny.
Sheldon: That's just wrong.
%
Sheldon: I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while
you preside over the kiddie table of yours.
%
*In the jail*
Sheldon: That's the toilet?
Policeman: Well, it sure ain't a wishin' well!
Sheldon: Please tell your judge I'm ready to apologize.
%
Sheldon: *After just being jailed, at the biggest guy in the cell who's
sitting on a bench* That's my spot.
%
Penny: Did he somehow just give me the finger?
Howard: Not just the finger - the MOVING finger!
%
Sheldon (to Penny): While we live in a deterministic universe, you do have
free will. Now sit down.
%
*Raj comes in playing Darth Vader's background music from Star Wars*
Leonard: Would you please turn your shirt off?
Raj: What? I'm giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I'm
awesome and to be feared.
Wolowitz: Right. There's nothing more awesome and frightening than a man
who's got music blasting from between his nipples.
%
Leonard: What's a dogapus?
Sheldon: A hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend.
Leonard: There's someone working on that?
Sheldon: I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself for my 300th
birthday.
Leonard:  Wait a minute you hate dogs.
Sheldon: A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls; no one can hate that.
%
Howard: Hey look, it's Leonard and R2-D-bag!
%
Raj: I'm a lamb!
%
Leonard: Penny, Steve Wozniack was one of the co-founders of Apple
computer. He and Steve Jobs...
Penny: Yeah. I know who he is. I watch Dancing With the Stars.
%
Penny: Hey, nice knees!
Sheldon: Thank you! They're my mother's!
%
Penny: What up, Shel-bot?
%
Leonard: What ya doin' there? Working on a new plan to catch the road
runner?
%
Sheldon: What I am doing here is trying to determine when I am going to
die.
Leonard: A lot of people are working on that research.
%
Sheldon: At my age do you know how I'm statistically most likely to die?
Leonard: At the hands of your room mate?
Sheldon: An accident.
Leonard: That's how I'm going to make it look.
%
Sheldon: I don't understand why you're not enjoying this. Together, in
this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we're like 'Knight Rider.'
Leonard: Except, in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.
Sheldon: You mock the sphincter, but, the sphincter is a class of muscle
without which human beings couldn't survive. There are over 50 different
sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?
Leonard: I was wrong. This is exactly like Knight Rider.
%
Penny: Honey, have you ever run before?
Sheldon: Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens and one
particularly persistent PE teacher determined to bend me over and give me
a scoliosis test.
%
Howard: I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
Raj: That's two, dude. Write your own jokes.
%
Leonard: Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB? What's KBB?
Sheldon: Killed by badger.
Leonard: How's that?
Sheldon: It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, "I think there's a badger
living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight." Those were the last words
he ever spoke to us.
%
Penny: I'm a little low on cash.
Leonard: How much you got?
Penny: Nothing!
Leonard: How can you walk around with no money?
Penny: I'm cute, I get by.
%
Penny: You wanna turn yourself into some sort of robot?
Sheldon: Essentially, yes.
Penny: Okay, here's my question: Didn't you already do that?
%
Howard: (Repeating what Raj says) You're right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys
can run together.
Sheldon: That's an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the
illusion of time going faster.
Penny: No, it won't.
%
Sheldon: I believe I may have cholera.
Leonard: There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer when there
was no malaria in Pasadena.
%
Penny: The Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?
Sheldon: No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday. But it's nice when
things work out.
%
Howard: (To Raj) Really? That's your question? When did he put a ramp in?
%
Sheldon: (Trying to keep Leonard from reaching his room) Wait. Come back.
Halt. Authorized personnel only.
%
Penny: (To Howard and Raj) So either one of you weirdos wanna buy my
underwear? Only 1400 bucks.
%
Sheldon: Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
%
Leonard: Refresh my memory. Why didn't I just put you in the trunk?
Sheldon: Because I called Shotgun, remember?
%
Sheldon: You're my 15th favorite technological visionary.
Steve Wozniak: Only 15th?
Sheldon: It's still six spots above Steve Jobs.
%
Sheldon: Greetings, friends.
Leonard: (To Robot Sheldon) Greetings, whatever-the-hell you are.
%
Leonard: You could be Batman?
Sheldon: Yeah. I'm Batman See?
%
Leonard: What secret?
Sheldon: Mother Smokes in the car, Jesus is fine with it but don't tell
Dad...SSHHH!...
%
Howard: How's the air matress?
Sheldon: It's ok, if you don't mind sleeping on a bouncy castle.
%
Leonard: What happened to him?
Howard: He wouldn't sleep so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a
handfull of my mother's Valium in it. TAG YOU'RE IT!
%
Sheldon: And you thought the opposite of stupid loser was a Community
College Graduate?
%
Sheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny.
%
Wolowitz: Qu'est-ce que 'sup?
%
Sheldon: I'm Batman.
%
Wolowitz: Leonard, how was your date?
Leonard: Bite me!
%
Sheldon: When I try to deceive I have more nervous ticks than a lime
disease research facility.
(Penny stares at Sheldon)
Sheldon: It's a joke, it relies on a homonymic relationship between the
tick the blood sucking arachnid, and tick the involuntary muscular
contraction. I made it up myself.
%
Penny: So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating, Leonard would
get bored with me?
Sheldon: That depends.
Penny: On what?
Sheldon: Do you have a working knowledge on Quantum Physics?
Penny: No.
Sheldon: Do you speak Klingon?
Penny: No.
Sheldon: Do you know any card tricks?
%
Sheldon: Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat
them with a rock.
%
Leonard: How could you just sit there and let them spy on me!?
Sheldon: They were very smart! They used my complete lack of interest in
what you are doing.
%
Penny: Sheldon, could I ask you a question?
Sheldon: I would prefer that you not, but I wouldn't go so far as to
forbid it.
%
Sheldon: I promised Penny.
Leonard: Promised Penny what?
Sheldon: I wouldn't tell you the secret. (pause) Shhhhh!!!!
Leonard: What secret? Tell me the secret.
Sheldon: Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can't tell
dad.
Leonard: Not that secret, the other secret.
Sheldon: I'M BATMAN!!!! SHHHH!!!
%
Sheldon: When I try to decieve, I myself have more ticks then a
lyme-disease research facility.
%
Raj: Tag, you're it. (Running away, leaving Sheldon at Howard's front
door)
Howard: Shouldn't you put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
%
Raj: They don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate.
Sadly, that's my homerun swing.
%
Raj: He was a lot more fun when he no hope.
Howard: Give him time.
%
Penny: I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a
brainiac?
Sheldon: Oh! Well, a few years ago, he did go out with a woman who had a
Ph.D in French Literature.
Penny: How is that not a brainiac?
Sheldon: Well, for one thing, she was French.
%
Penny: Look, just forget I told you about me (sigh) not graduating from
community college, okay?
Sheldon: Forget? You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I
haven't forgotten a thing since the day my mother stopped breast-feeding
me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
%
Raj: I hate trains.
Sheldon: Oh, don't be silly, you love trains.
%
Sheldon: (To Raj) Obviously, you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.
*Raj stares at Sheldon.*
%
Mrs. Wolowitz:What's going on? Are you boys rough housing?
Howard: We're just talking, Ma!
Mrs. Wolowitz: If you don't settle down right now, I'm not gonna let you
have any more sleepovers.
Howard: For God's Sake, Ma, I'm 27 years old. And it's not even a school
night.
%
Leonard: Penny thinks I'm too smart for her. That's ridiculous!
Sheldon: (Drugged up) I know! Most of your work is extremely derivative.
And don't worry, that's not a secret.
%
Howard: Do you wanna switch beds?
Sheldon: No, I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a ... bouncy castle.
%
Sheldon: Oh yes, I've just discovered I don't have enough room on my hard
drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full
backup, re-initialize and then re-install all my operating systems.
%
Penny: Oh, Voodoo is real. You don't want to mess with Voodoo.
%
Sheldon: Hulk sad!
%
Sheldon: Goodnight puny human!
%
Leonard: What's going on?
Sheldon: We scored. I'm the wingman. *Wave with guitar*.
%
Leonard: How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
Howard: Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.
Leonard: And that didn't bother you?
Howard: Au contraire. It meant that she was gullible and open to a little
probing.
%
Sheldon: (after Leonard whistles two notes) FIRST WARNING!
%
Sheldon: A fear of heights is illogical. A fear of falling, on the other
hand, is prudent and evolutionary.
%
Sheldon: What part of an inverse tangent approaching an asymptote don't
you understand?
%
Sheldon: That's awfully sticky.
%
Sheldon: Your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because
ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I'm given to
understand that your mother is overweight.
Raj: Oh, snap.
Sheldon: Now of course if that is a result of a glandular condition and
not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.
Raj: What difference does it make, fat is fat!
Sheldon: There are boundaries!
%
Wolowitz: *After he fixed Sheldon's algorithm* Gee, why can't Sheldon get
a friend?
%
Penny: What about Howard and Raj? How did he become friends with them?
Leonard: I dunno. How do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and
valence electrons.
Penny: Sure - when you put it like that.
%
Sheldon: (Looking for a book) "Barney bunny has two daddies now" Probably
something about homosexual rabbits.
%
Sheldon: Gerry the Gerbil and the bully boys on the bus- read it, not
helpful.
%
Amy: If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow. One of the
test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both
tragic and hysterical.
%
Sheldon: Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn't be living here. I'd be
in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my
death ray.
%
Leonard: I'm going to the movies with Penny. I don't want her to think I
think it's a date.
Sheldon: Do you think it's a date?
Leonard: No, but she might think I think it's a date even though I don't.
Sheldon: Or you might think she thinks you think it's a date even though
she doesn't.
Leonard: Are we over thinking this?
Sheldon: Not at all.
%
Leonard: Star Wars on Blu-ray.
Penny: Haven't you seen that movie like a thousand times?
Leonard: Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
Penny: Oh, Leonard.
Leonard: I know, it's high resolution sadness.
%
Penny: And,remember he's more afraid of you than you are of him.
Sheldon: That doesn't help.
Penny: No, I was talking to the bird.
%
(Leonard is dressed in t-shirt, jeans, and backwards ball cap)
Leonard: Too casual?
Sheldon: For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a
bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.
%
(Leonard is pointing out the monotonous movie habits of their former
relationship.)
Leonard: No. You always picked and it was always the same. An hour and a
half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes
love was here all along.
Penny: But, come on, that was a great movie and it starts in ten minutes.
%
Raj: Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.
Howard: I'm pushing play. I mean it. If we don't start soon, George Lucas
is going to change it again.
%
Sheldon: Come back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you.
%
Penny: Really? On top of everything you're afraid of birds?
Sheldon: Its called ornithophobia and someday it will be recognized as a
true disability and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant
net over the building, which is unfortunate because I have a fear of nets.
%
Leonard: Do you think I'm overdressed?
Sheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam? Yes. If you're
playing Vegas, I'd add sequins.
%
Sheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
%
Sheldon: I need your help in a matter of semiotics.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols as a branch of the
philosophy related to linguistics.
Penny: Okay, honey, I know you think you are explaining yourself, but
you're really not.
%
Sheldon: Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger: the Big
Boy.
Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would
I settle for something that's like a Big Boy?
%
Sheldon: (At The Cheesecake Factory) Who do I speak to about permanently
reserving this table?
Penny: I don't know, a psychiatrist?
%
Leslie: Come for the breasts, stay for the brains!
%
Leslie: Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
%
Sheldon: You're a lucky man, Leonard.
Leonard: Why is that?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of only three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
%
Leslie: Listen Leonard, neither of us are neuro-scientists, but we both
understand the bio-chemistry of sex, ... I mean: Dopamine in our brain is
released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's
brain, give him an orgasm button and he'll push that thing 'till he
starves to death.
Leonard: Who wouldn't?
%
Sheldon: Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
%
Leslie: (To the guys) I didn't know you eat here.
Sheldon: We don't, this is a disturbing aberration.
%
Leonard: Leslie, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and
me.
Howard: ... And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Penny: Howard, I asked you not to do that.
%
Sheldon: My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
Leonard: Are you sure?
Sheldon: Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum
chromodynamics. The sign's been changed.
Leonard: Oh, yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? (looking at board) Are
you--? Hey, look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
%
Leonard: If Penny didn't know that Leslie had already turned me down then
that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her,
Leslie, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her,
Penny, out but because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that
she, Leslie, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering me
consolation. "That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple" but while
thinking "good, Leonard remains available."
Sheldon: You're a lucky man Leonard.
Leonard: How so?
Sheldon: You're talking to one of three men in the western hemisphere
capable of following that train of thought.
Leonard: Well, what do you think?
Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared
%
Sheldon: All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
%
Wolowitz: He doesn't do anything for me. If I were going to go that way,
I'm more of a Zac Efron kind of guy.
Raj: Oh yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Efron.
%
Sheldon: You bought me a present? Why would you do such a thing? I know
you think you're being generous, but the foundation of gift giving is
reciprocity. You haven't given me a gift, you've given me an obligation.
The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for
you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level
of friendship as that represented by the gift you've given me. Ah, it's no
wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year. Oh, I brought this on
myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life...
%
Sheldon: If I would give you this gift basket, based on that action alone
and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that
exist between us.
Store clerk: Excuse me?
Sheldon: Here. *Giving the gift basket*
Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?
Store clerk: I don't understand what you're talking about and you're
making me a little uncomfortable
Howard: See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We'll take it.
%
Howard:Hey, isn't that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last
year? (everyone looks) No, not all at once.
Raj: Then how?
Howard: Leonard. (Leonard looks) Now Raj. (Raj looking) Now Sheldon.
(Sheldon looking)
Raj: I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?
Howard: No!
%
Leonard: Here's my home number, here's my cell, here's my office, here's
my parents' number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me.
%
Leonard: What are you looking at? You've never seen a hypocrite before?
%
Howard: Gather around, kids. It's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas
special.
%
Howard: Don't feel bad, Penny. It's a classic rookie mistake. My first
Chanukah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.
%
Penny: (To David) Usually the physicists I know are indoors-y and pale.
Leonard: I'm not indoors-y. I just wear the appropriate sun block because
I don't take melanoma lightly.
%
Leonard: By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
%
Leonard: Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly
happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn't wanna
go out with me because I was too smart for you. Well, news flash, lady:
David Underhill is 10 times smarter than me. You'd have to drive a
railroad spike into his head for me to beat him at checkers. Next to him,
I'm one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes.
So my question is what's up with that?
Penny: (tearfully) Why are you yelling at me?
Leonard: Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Never mind, we're cool.
%
Wolowitz: Have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of
skim milk?
%
Penny: Oh you're going to jibber jabber about jibber jabber!
%
Raj: Rotting Zombie ... Sheldon's new Facebook picture!
%
Raj: Hell hounds! Who let the satanic dogs out?
%
Sheldon: Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me
home.
Howard: What's wrong with the bathroom here?
Sheldon: Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other sort of
cocusses.
Howard: Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancé is
grief-stricken over putting her there. I'm NOT taking you home!
Sheldon: Will you at least go with me to the restroom here so you can open
the door and flush the urinal?
Howard: NO!
Sheldon: This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship
requires a certain give and take!
%
Leonard: Does your family have a history of heart disease?
Wolowitz: My family is the history of heart disease. There's a cave
painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this. *Mimics heart
attack*
%
Sheldon: 'He drank from Leonard`s glass' - the words they will be carving
into my tombstone.
%
Leonard: I'm the king of foreplay.
%
Bernadette: You're a putz! Do you what that means?
Howard: Yeah. Do you?
%
Priya: Indian parents are very protective of their children.
Howard: Right. Whereas Jewish mothers take a casual la-di-da approach to
their sons!
%
Sheldon: Zandor, wizard of the north. Ha! I win!
Howard: If you skip the part about under a two week quarantine because you
were exposed to a deadly disease, ABSOLUTELY!
%
Priya: What happened?
Bernadette: Howard's mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him
and she can't.
%
Bernadette: Howard's mother had a heart attack because I can have sex with
him and she can't!
%
Priya: My brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed
up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power
Rangers.
Penny: How old were they?
Priya: Not as young as you'd want them to be.
%
Sheldon: I gaggled with tequila. I may have swallowed a tiny bit.
Leonard: You all right?
Sheldon: Fine, thank you for asking. I love you so much!
%
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
Biosuit Nurse: Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.
Sheldon: (Covering his face with his shirt) No, I haven't! It's all good!
%
Howard: You can't do "Buzz." Buzz is taken.
Raj: Buzz Lightyear is not real.
Howard: No, that's not what I'm talking about.
Raj: Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?
Howard: No.
%
Sheldon: Wine and a girl in the dark ... he's going to be bored out of his
mind.
%
Sheldon: You're my girlfriend and you're not going to cater to my every
need? Where'd the magic go?
%
Sheldon: I would have been here sooner but the bus kept stopping for other
people to get on it.
%
Penny: Sheldon, that's not what girlfriends are for. Although you don't
use them for what they're for, so what do I know?
%
Leonard: You call that a glow stick? *Pulls out a Lightsaber* This is a
glow stick!
%
Sheldon: To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
%
Raj: They don't call me Brown Dynamite for nothin'.
%
Howard: I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston
for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
Penny: What does that mean?
Bernadette: He's gonna to learn to poop in space.
Howard: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
Raj: Maybe your nickname should be "Brown Dynamite."
%
Leonard: Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.
Sheldon: Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon
can stop them?
%
Astronaut Mike Massimino: (Talking to Howard) No problem ... Fruit Loops.
%
Leonard: Oh, great! I get another night in front of our apartment dressed
like one of the Village People!
Sheldon: You tell that joke every 3 months, and I still don't get it!
%
Mrs Wolowitz: Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!
%
Sheldon: Rise and shine sleepy head, half the town is dead.
%
Sheldon: It took me a gallon of urine to get that water!
%
Leonard: Not only that Sheldon saved my life, but that he didn't report me
to the landlord, or the police, or homeland security!
%
Penny: Okay, Babydoll Pink, let's see if you can cover up the fact that I
got my dad's feet.
%
Sheldon: This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
Leonard: Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
Sheldon: No, you don't screw the roommate agreement. The roommate
agreement screws you.
%
Leonard: You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.
Sheldon: I don't have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I'm there already!
%
Penny: Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the
other fella went bat-crap crazy.
%
Sheldon: Oh, Ubuntu. You're my favorite Linux-based operating system.
%
TV Announcer: Up next Babylon 5.
(Sheldon looks at Leonard)
(Penny listening to Sheldon and Leonard argue from her apartment)
Leonard: You're not even watching it!
Sheldon: I can hear it!
Leonard: The dialogue offends you?!
%
Sheldon: When do you evacuate your bowels?
Leonard: When I have to.
Sheldon: When you have to? I'm sorry I don't rent to hippies.
%
Leonard: Hey, excuse me, I'm looking for a Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Asian Guy: Oh, so you're here about the room.
Leonard: Yeah!
Asian Guy: Run Away Dude.
Leonard: Wait, what?
Asian Guy: Run Fast, Run Far!
%
Sheldon: What's the sixth noble gas?
Leonard: Uh... Radon?
Sheldon: Are you asking me or telling me?
Leonard: Telling You?
(Sheldon gives Leonard a stern look)
Leonard: Telling you.
%
Sheldon: I assure you, you'll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod
when Microsoft comes out with theirs.
%
Stephanie: *Looking in Sheldon's ear with an otoscope* I don't see
anything at all Sheldon.
Sheldon: Ahh, Well you're the doctor but I am constantly hearing this
annoying sound.
Leonard: Me too.
Sheldon: Is it a high frequency whistle?
Leonard: No its more of a relentess narcassistic drone.
%
Leonard: No absolutely not!
Sheldon: It's not a big deal.We have latex gloves.  
Leonard: I don't care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to
give you a prostate exam.
%
Leonard: Don't you think if a woman was living with me I'd be the first
one to know about it?
Penny: Oh sweetie you'd be the last to know about it
%
Sheldon: I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
Leonard: Oh good God! Sheldon we don't ask questions like that!
Sheldon: I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me
to ask it once?
Stephanie: He did very nicely.
Sheldon: See? She's not offended. And now you FINALLY have an answer.
%
Sheldon's computer: We are out of herbal tea. Do you have any?
Penny: Hold on, I'll go check.
Sheldon's computer: Some hiney would be nice. (Sheldon realizes his
mistake right away)
Penny (offended): Hiney?
(Sheldon retypes)
Sheldon's computer: Honey.
%
Stephanie: Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
Sheldon: My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought
if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back
on.
%
Leonard: Maybe, it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those
childhood toilet swirlies.
Sheldon: (to Stephanie) Is that possible? I used to get those all the
time. Even in church.
Stephanie: Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there's something I can
do, okay, Ahem. Circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot.
%
Sheldon: I've never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs.
Vartabedian.
Leonard: She doesn't like you.
%
Sheldon: What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
%
Leonard: Where's my Bat-Signal?
Penny: You have a Bat-Signal?
Leonard: I did. It was right here. She must have-- Oh, my God, we're
living together.
%
Howard: New pants?
Leonard: Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.
Howard: Nice. Cotton?
Leonard: Actually, I think it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.
%
Sheldon: Are you upset about something?
Leonard: What was your first clue?
Sheldon: Well there was a number of things. First the late hour, then you
demeanors seems very low energy plus your irritability...
Leonard: Yes I'm upset!
Sheldon: Oh... I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
Leonard: Yeah good for you.
Sheldon: (walks away and then turns back) Oh, wait. Did you want to talk
about what's bothering you?
Leonard: I don't know... maybe.
Sheldon: Wow! I'm on fire tonight.
%
Sheldon: A little misunderstanding? Galileo and the Pope had a little
misunderstanding...
%
Leonard : I just assumed. Who sells a full-sized time machine for $800?
%
Sheldon : In a vent diagram that would be an individual located within the
intersection of the sets 'no longer want my time machine' and 'need $800'
%
[While pushing the time machine upstairs]
Leonard: Come on, guys, push!
Sheldon: If I push any harder I'm gonna give birth to my colon.
%
Leonard: Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
Sheldon: Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock
me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated
you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.
Leonard: What if I knock you unconscious now?
Sheldon: It won't change the past.
Leonard: But it'd make the present so much nicer.
%
Penny: It is the things you love that make you who you are.
Wolowitz: I guess that makes me large breasts.
%
Penny: I'm running really late (to work).
Sheldon: Then I have a simple solution: Go up to the roof, hop over to
next building, there's a small gap, don't look if you suffer of vertigo,
and use their stairwell.
Penny: You are joking, right?
Sheldon: Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.
%
Sheldon: Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for
turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat.
Raj: What did they give you?
Sheldon: Turkey and Roast beef with swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.
*The guys look at Sheldon*
Sheldon: It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper
sandwich, the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a
car wash.
%
Leonard: How are we gonna get it upstairs?
Sheldon: If we take the dish off, it might fit in the elevator.
Leonard: Yes, but the elevator's been broken for two years.
Sheldon: I've been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call
about that?
Howard: Not necessary, I have a master's in engineering. I remotely repair
satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot satellite payloads. When the
Mars Rover started pulling to the left, I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away. (Pushing button on elevator) Nah, that baby's
broken.
%
Penny: Oh, please, it's not a time machine, if anything, it looks like
something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.
Sheldon: It only moves in time, it would be worse than useless in a swamp.
%
Howard: Looks what you created here, it's like Nerdvana.
%
Penny: What the hell's going on?
Sheldon: You hypocrite!
Penny: What?!
Sheldon: Little Miss Grown-Ups-Don't-Play-With-Toys! If I went into that
apartment right now, would I not find Beanie Babies? Are you not an
accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese
feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello, Hello Kitty!
%
Sheldon: Oh, no, not Morlocks, not flesh eating Morlocks!
Helllllllllllllllllp!
%
Raj: Did the listing actually saying "Miniature"?
Leonard: (Looking at time machine) I just assumed.
%
Leonard:You guys ready?
Raj: In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, it's 2 in the morning.
Leonard: So?
Sheldon: (Referring to time machine) So, it's my turn.
%
Raj: Hold on a second. Kreplach??
Howard: Yeah.
Raj: That isn't Klingon. It's yiddish for meat-filled dumpling!
Howard: Well, as it turns out it's also a Klingon word.
Leonard: Really? Define it.
Howard: Kreplach a hearty Klingon.....dumpling.
%
Sheldon: Is my hamburger medium-well?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Dill slices not sweet?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Individual relish packets?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Onion rings?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Extra-breading?
Leonard: I asked.
Sheldon: What did they say?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Did you protest?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Vociferously?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Well, then what took you so long?
%
Leonard: (Discussing Sheldon). Yeah, yeah, ah, see here's the thing, after
you leave, I still have to live with him.
%
Wolowitz (watching America's Next Top Model): Oh, look! That's the future
Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait! That's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in
the lap of... what a coincidence... is the future Mrs. Wolowitz.
Leonard: Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother. The
current Mrs. Wolowitz.
%
Wolowitz: If it's "creepy" to use the Internet, military satellites, and
robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so I can drop
in on them unexpected, then fine, I'm "creepy".
%
Penny: You didn't know? You have three strikes. Strike 1- You came in,
Strike 2- You sat down and Strike 3- I don't like your attitude.
%
Penny: No Shirt, No Shoes, No Sheldon.
%
Penny: Another night? I guess your could try... but deep inside your heart
you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
Sheldon: Woman, you're playing with forces beyond your ken
Penny: Yeah, well your Ken can kiss my Barbie.
%
Sheldon: Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.
Penny: Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my barbie.
%
Sheldon: *On cinoyter screen* Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are
probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how
much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you
that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If
you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up
your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.
Penny: Well?
Leonard: I reiterate, knuckle under.
Penny: No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a
world of hurt.
Leonard: Oh, Penny, you don%u2019t want to get into it with Sheldon. The
guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.
%
Leonard: Penny, you don't want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy's one
lab accident away from being a super villain.
%
Sheldon: And then you put it back, compromising the rest of the onion
rings.
Penny: Aw honey, the buses don't go where you live do they?
%
Sheldon: When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is
possible. And may I add, "Mwah, ha, ha."
%
Penny: No Shirt, No Shoes, No Sheldon.
Howard: (Aside to Raj) I bet we could sell THAT sign all over Pasadena!!
%
Sheldon: Excuse me, Penny, but...
Leonard: Don't tell her.
Sheldon: We're playing Klingon Boggle.
Leonard: Awww!
Howard: What do you mean "Aww?" Like she didn't know we were nerds?
%
Sheldon: (Playing Boggle) Oh, worf, nice, too bad that's a proper noun.
%
Penny: What was my first strike?
Sheldon: March 18th, you violated my rule about forwarding email humor.
Penny: I did?
Sheldon: The photo of the cat who wants to "Has Cheeseburger?"
Penny: Oh, come on, everybody loves Lolcats. They're cute and they can't
spell ... because they're cats.
Sheldon: I trusted you with my email address and you betrayed that trust
by sending me internet banality. Strike one. Touching my food. Strike two.
%
Penny: I like hanging out with you guys, but I'm gonna apologize for
something I didn't do.
Leonard: Well, actually, technically, you did do it.
Penny: That's strike one, Leonard.
%
Sheldon: (On computer screen) Hello, puny insects, as a consequence of
your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional
strike.
Leonard: Thanks a lot, Howard.
Howard: What are you complaining about? I'm the one who has to take the
class again.
%
Penny: Look, I said I wanted to hurt him (Sheldon), but this-- but this?
Leonard: It will shorten the was by five years and save millions of lives.
%
Penny: Where are my clothes?
Sheldon: Your clothes?
Penny: Yes. I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them,
they were gone.
Sheldon: Really? Despite the sign that says: "Do not leave laundry
unattended?"
%
Penny: I was in junior rodeo. I can hogtie and castrate him (Sheldon) in
60 seconds.
%
Penny: Here you go, (to Leonard) Quesadilla, (to Howard) Salad, (to Raj)
Here's your pizza. And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion with my
manager, one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon, and
cheese on the side.
Sheldon: Thank you!
Penny: Go ahead. Eat it!
*Sheldon looks at Penny.*
Penny: I dare you!
*Sheldon looks at his burger.*
%
Sheldon:You know, I do call seeing some female undergarments. Where was
that? Oh, yes. Earlier this evening, I appened to gaze out the window and
a brassiere aught my eye. (Pointing out the window) Do those look
familiar?
Penny: How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
Sheldon: When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is
possible. And may I add: Mua-ha-ha!
%
Sheldon: (on the phone) Hi, Mom, how are you? (mood changes) But, Mom, she
keeps sitting in my spot. And she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her
clothes, but she started it. (throwing a fit) No, that's not fair. Why
should I have to apologize? I really don't think this is the kind of thing
Jesus concerns himself with. No, you're right. I don't really know what
Jesus thinks about. All right! Goodbye. (hangs up) (to Leonard)Did you
tell on me?
Leonard: Are you kidding me? I already have 2 strikes
%
Penny: This has gotten way out of hand, okay. I've done some stupid
things, you've done some stupid things. How about we just call it even,
and move on with our lives?
Sheldon: I've done no stupid things.
Penny: Look, you've gotta meet me halfway here.
Sheldon: I am meeting you halfway. I'm willing to concede that you've done
some stupid things.
%
Sheldon: Alright, Klingons, pencils down.
%
Penny: Hey, guys. What'd I miss, what'd I miss?
Howard: Giselle's hanging by a thread.
Penny: Oh, good, I hate her.
Howard: Then you're not invited to our wedding.
%
Sheldon: [To Penny] You just got off the list, would you like back on it?
%
Amy: Now Sheldon, I know you're a left handed monkey wrench but you
seriously have a mortal enemy
Sheldon: Yes, in fact I have 61. Would you like to see the list?
%
Sheldon: (To Brent Spiner) You are now my mortal enemy.
Wil Wheaton: (To Brent Spiner) Don't worry it doesn't take up too much of
your time.
%
Bernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you're not going to space!
%
Sheldon: This will just take a moment, it's on a five and a quarter inch
floppy.
Amy: A floppy disk?
Sheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.
%
Sheldon: Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party you are
simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I'm characterizing this
phenomenon as Schrodinger's Friendship.
%
Penny: Wait, what is going on?
Sheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger's cat is a thought
experiment.
Penny: No, no, no, no, I didn't forget. Um, there's this cat in a box and
until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both. Although, back in
Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother's camp trunk, and we did not
need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.
Amy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it.
You're the whole package, aren't you?
%
Leonard: Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.
Sheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks
it's doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you're
looking for.
Leonard: I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the
empire!
Sheldon: Not yet.
%
*Leonard, Howard & Raj are avoiding hypochondriac Sheldon at the cinema &
Penny calls Leonard.*
%
Leonard (to Howard & Raj): Sheldon is at the Cheesecake Factory.
Leonard (to Penny): Just tell him to go home.
Penny: Well, he won't leave. He says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus
and someone will harvest his organs.
Leonard (to Howard & Raj): He is paranoid and he has established a nest.
%
Sheldon: Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any
English. When I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said,
"Möchtest du eine Darmspülung?"
Penny: What does that mean?
Sheldon: Based on what happened next, I assume it means, 'Would you like
an enema?'
%
*Playing 3D chess*
Sheldon: Checkmate.
Leonard: Oh, again?
Sheldon: Obviously, you're not suited for three dimensional chess. Perhaps
three dimensional Candy Land would be more your speed.
Leonard: Just reset the board!
Sheldon: It must be humbling to suck on so many levels.
%
Sheldon: Wait, put this in the bathroom.
Leonard: What for?
Sheldon: I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my
kidneys aren't shutting down.
Leonard: I mix pancake batter in this!
Sheldon: No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.
Leonard: You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment,
including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make a label
that said "urine cup"?
Sheldon: It's right here on the bottom.
Leonard: Huh, I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company a letter of apology.
%
Howard's mom (HM): Howard it's the phone!
Howard: I know it's the phone ma' I HEAR THE PHONE!
HM: Who is calling at this ungodly hour?
Howard: I don't know!
HM: Well ask them why are they calling at this ungodly houer!
Howard: HOW CAN I ASK THEM WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!?. *on the phone*
Hello?
%
Raj: How about Lasik?
Leonard: You want me to get eye surgery?
Raj: Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon or
have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
Howard: Well?
Leonard:I'm thinking
%
Sheldon: Soft Kitty, Warm Kitty, Little Ball of Fur! Happy Kitty, Sleepy
Kitty, Pur, Pur, Pur!
%
Sheldon: Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup
while I still understand what a spoon is for.
%
Sheldon: What kind of sick?
Penny: Oh, the flu, I guess.
Sheldon: I don't need you to guess, I need you to know. Now, when did the
symptoms first appear?
Penny: Maybe Friday!
Sheldon: Friday! Was that morning or afternoon?
Penny: I don't--
Sheldon: Think, woman! Who blew their nose and when?
%
Leonard: Sheldon, you are not sick, but this is.
Sheldon: We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into
our environment, and having never been to Nebraska, I'm certain I have no
corn-husking antibodies.
Leonard: Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?
Sheldon: When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds
to cure me, these gelatin cultures and my accompanying notes will give
them a fighting chance.
*Sheldon holds Q-tip toward mouth for Leonard to swab.*
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) Howard, I'm sick.
Howard: (Hesitating, Imitating Mrs. Wolowitz) Howard's sleeping, this is
his mother talking, why are you calling at this ungodly hour?
Sheldon: I need soup!
Howard: (Imitating Mrs. Wolowitz) Then call your own mother.
%
Sheldon: I can't believe he fired me.
Leonard: Well, you did call him a "glorified high school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon: In my defense, I prefaced that with, "with all due respect."
%
Howard: (to Mary, Sheldon's mother) Forgive me for being so bold, but I
now see where Sheldon gets his charming good looks.
Mary: Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep trying.
%
Mary: (to Rajesh) I made chicken. I hope it's not one of the animals that
you people think is magic.
%
Penny: This is the best cobbler I've ever had.
Mary Cooper: It was always Sheldon's favorite. You know what the secret
ingredient is?
Penny: Love?
Mary Cooper: Lard.
%
Mary Cooper: [To Sheldon] You know how your daddy used to say that you
could only fish for so long before you gotta throw a stick of dynamite in
the water?
%
Mary Cooper: I tell you, I love that boy [Sheldon] to death but he has
been difficult since he fell outta me at the K-Mart.
%
Mary: Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Luckily He
blessed me with two other children who are as dumb as soup.
%
Sheldon: I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
%
Penny: So you got canned, huh?
%
Sheldon: Theoretical physicists do not get 'canned'. But yeah.
%
Penny: I always say that when one door closes, another one opens.
Sheldon: No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays
or there are motion sensors involved. Or if the first door closing creates
a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny: (gives Sheldon a long look) Never mind.
%
Mary Cooper: (looking at Leonard and Penny, who happen to be sitting next
to each other) You know, you two make a cute couple.
Leonard: No, no we're not, we're not a couple, we're single, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends.  
Mary Cooper: (aside, to Howard) Did I pluck a nerve there?
Howard: Oh yeah.
%
Sheldon: Aha, the thing about tomatoes, I think you will really enjoy
this, is that they are shelved with the vegetables but they are
technically a fruit.
Penny: Intresting.
Sheldon: Isn't it!  
Penny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
%
Sheldon: I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from
luminous jelly fish into other animals; and I thought "Hey! Fish
night-lights".
Leonard: Fish night-lights ...
Sheldon: It's a billion dollar idea ... SHUSH!!!!
%
Wolowitz: Whaddup science b*tches?
%
Mary Cooper: Honey, why did you get a loom?
Sheldon: Well, I was working with luminous fish and I thought... Hey.
Loom.
%
Leonard: Howard brought a date?
Sheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has
made an amazing leap forward.
%
Mary Cooper: I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words, "If it
pleases Your Highness?"
%
Sheldon: Oh boy...
Penny: What now?
Sheldon: Well, there's some value to taking the multivitamins, but the
human body can only absorb so much, so what you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.
Penny: Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
Sheldon: Well, then you would want some manganese.
%
Sheldon: There wouldn't have been any ass kickings if that stupid death
ray had worked.
%
Gablehauser: Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a
teenager.
Mary Cooper: Oh, aren't you sweet, his Father's dead.
%
Mary Cooper: Sheldon's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
%
Sheldon: You know, I've been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard: Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Sheldon: Put it on the back burner.
%
Sheldon: The last department party, Professor Finkleday cornered me and
talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Leonard: Yes, I was there.
Sheldon: You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Nothing!
%
Mary: He gets his temper from his daddy.
Leonard: Ah!
Mary: He's got my eyes.
Leonard: I see!
Mary: All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
%
Sheldon: Go Team Leonard!
%
Sheldon: Looks like we butchered a pig but no one wanted bacon.
%
Penny: Oh, damn, they canceled my Visa. *sadness* Oh, yay, a new
MasterCard!
%
Wolowitz: You said you were going for a walk.
Sheldon: I didn't say outside.
%
Raj: Hey, Leonard?
Leonard: Yeah?
Raj: I haven't had sex in a year.
Leonard: Where are you going with this, Raj?
Raj: Don't flatter yourself, dude.
%
Leonard: I'm not going out tonight, Raj.
Raj: All right.Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some
Asian pornography?
Leonard: Very much.
Raj: Doesn't have to be Asian.
%
Raj: Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour
pork?
Wolowitz:Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux.
%
Penny:I think we can make it!
Leonard: Make what?
Penny: Make it as friends.
Leonard:Can we be friends that are having sex?
Penny: What!?
Leonard: Don't worry I was just goofin' aroud!
*Leonard and Penny got out of Sheldon's room*
Sheldon: *dreaming* Not Goofy, no!
%
Leonard: What do you want?
Sheldon: You may wanna sit down.
Leonard: I'm in bed!
Sheldon: Point taken. You may wanna sit up.
%
Leonard: Hey, where've you been?
Sheldon: I was talking with Penny.
Howard: What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex.
That's totally uncool.
Leonard: No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.
Raj: Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day about trying
to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
Sheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck
as Daredevil.
Howard: So would Ben Affleck.
%
Penny: So, how've you been?
Sheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each
point in the implied time period.
%
Leonard: Is it possible that he said bros before hoes?
Sheldon: Yes, but I rephrased to avoid offending the hoes.
%
Wolowitz: Get your hands off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.
%
Sheldon: Oh, and one more thing, it's on b*tch.
%
Wolowitz: He [Raj] compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing
product one might use on a Summer's Eve.
%
Howard: (reading his mobile phone) Ooh, more details about the new Star
Trek film! There is going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth. Raj: I'd
be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.
%
(Arguing over the name for their team after having jointly decided to take
part in the University Physics Bowl:)
Sheldon: Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures thus
intimidating one's opponent.
Raj: Then we could be the Bengal tigers.
Sheldon: Poor choice. You know, gram for gram no animal exceeds the
relative fighting strength of the army ant.
Raj: Maybe so, but you can't incinerate a Bengal tiger with a magnifying
glass.
%
Sheldon: What rat have you recruited to the SS sinking ship?
Leslie: Hello Sheldon.
Sheldon: Leslie Winkle.
Leslie: Yeah Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon
Cooper cry like a little girl?
Sheldon: Yes well I am polymerised tree saps and you are an inorganic
adhesive so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is
reflected off me, returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you.  
Leslie: Oh, ouch.
%
Leslie: There's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen
each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of
coitus. Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding
your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still
protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.
%
*Raj laughs in an "evil" way*
Wolowitz: That's more like: We're tall thin women who want to make a coat
out of your Dalmatians.
%
Sheldon: You're asking me to use my superior intellect in a tawdry
competition. Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah
Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
%
Leonard: Come on, you need a four-person team. We're four people
Sheldon: By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a huppah
and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.
%
Howard: Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an
engineer.
Sheldon: By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions
because I'm a mammal.
%
Raj: I say we wait until he looks at us then laugh, like "Yes, you're a
smart and strong competitor but we're also smart and strong and we have a
reasonable chance in defeating you".
Leonard: How exactly would that laugh go?
*Raj laughs*
Howard: That sounds more like "We are a tall thin woman who wants to make
a coat out of your dalmatians"
%
(Sheldon and Leonard stare at Penny quietly)
Sheldon: A romulan.
Penny: Yes, he tawt he taw a romulan.
%
Sheldon: Look, you may have democracy in your beloved Russia, but on this
physics bowl team, I rule with an iron fist. (Raising his fist) OW!
%
Leonard: (Talking about Spock) His mother was human, his father was
Vulcan, they couldn't conceive.
Howard: Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Can you imagine Spock's dad in a
room with a copy of "Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears"?
%
Penny: Wow! So in your world, you're like the cool guys.
Howard: Recognize!
%
Leonard: This is our year, with those guys out, the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.
Penny: Zod?
Howard: Kryptonian villain, long story.
Raj: Good Story! (Covering his mouth, realizing he spoke to Penny sober)
%
Sheldon: I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my
old Nintendo injury.
%
Howard: We'll just have to face Sheldon mano y mano y mano a mano.
Leslie: Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?
Howard:Yes!
Leslie: That arrogant, misogynistic, East Texas doorknob that told I
should abandon my work with high-energy particles for laundry and child
bearing?
Leonard: She's in!
%
Howard: (Answering a Question) Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.
The approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.
Gablehauser: Mr. Wolowitz, this is your second warning.
%
Gablehauser: AA, I need your official answer.
Sheldon: Well, it's not what he said.
Gablehauser: Then what is it?
Sheldon: I want a different question.
Gablehauser: You can't have a different question.
Sheldon: Formal Protest!
Gablehauser: Denied!
Sheldon: Informal Protest!
Gablehauser: Denied! I need your official answer.
Sheldon: No, I decline to provide one.
Gablehauser: Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave
was correct.
Sheldon: That's your opinion.
%
Janitor: (Answering question) The answer is minus eight pi alpha.
Sheldon: Hang on a second, that's not our answer. What are you doing?
Janitor: Answering question, winning Physics Bowl.
Sheldon: How do you know anything about physics?
Janitor: Here, I am janitor. In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.
Leningrad Politechnika. Go Polar Bears!
%
Leonard: I had a great idea. Do you know how we're always having to stop
and solve differential equations, like when you're doing Fourier equations
or using the Schroedinger equation?
Sheldon: Howard doesn't, he's only an engineer.
%
Rajesh: (Talking to Wolowitz) Last night I had a dream we got so rich from
the app, you and I bought matching side by side mansions, but there was a
secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you
think that means?
%
Raj: Ooh, Leonard is going all alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass!
%
Sheldon: I'm not saying that all senior citizens that can't master
technology should be publicly flogged. But, if we made an example of one
or two it might give the others incentive to try harder.
%
Sheldon: Hear me out, the atomic bomb was the Manhattan project, Windows
95 was Project Chicago, for our app I humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.
%
Sheldon: #Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Nobody knows my sorrow#
%
Raj: (Talking to the snake) Let's go to the biology lab and find you some
nice yummy mice. *Raj leaves the room*
Sheldon: I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You're
better than this.
%
Sheldon: All right, so the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably
won't be relying on Suess here. Although One Fish Two Fish, Red Fish Blue
Fish might be surprisingly applicable here.
%
Sheldon: It's me, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Howard: That's not my mom, that's Bernadette.
Sheldon: Really? That's rather unsettling.
%
Leonard: No no, you have it wrong. I was going to be a jerk but I stopped
myself
%
Leonard: More Halloween candy. I thought you already bought some.
Penny: Yeah, that's gone. It's a bad month when Halloween and PMS hit at
the same time.
%
Sheldon: Bazinga punk! Now we're even!
%
Wolowitz: (To Leonard) Did I just see you pick up a girl in a comic book
store?
Stuart: Because if you did, you get your picture up there, on the Wall of
Heroes.
%
Sheldon: I am also a son of the Lonestar state. I'm Texas through and
through. And we know how to settle scores down there... if you doubt me,
just ask Mexico.
%
Sheldon: You know, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche believed
that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings
to hold back the few superior men ... It's worth noting that he died of
syphilis.
%
Sheldon: "See you in hell Sheldon" The most frightening about that is the
missing comma.
%
Sheldon: Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow!
%
(after scaring Sheldon with his mailbox prank) You may be from Texas, but
I'm from New Jersey.
%
(Leonard & Alice are kissing)
Leonard: Damn it, I can't. I can't do this.
Alice: Is it my tongue stud? 'Cause if that freaks you out, you're in for
a real surprise later on.
%
(Leonard is discussing his dating conundrum.)
Leonard: Well ... they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff
you didn't do more than the stuff that you did. And, I'm pretty sure Alice
is the stuff I want to do.
%
Penny: It's a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
%
Leonard: Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
Sheldon: Droll.
Howard: Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own
urine.
Leonard: That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
%
Penny: Leonard, you're looking for a way to sleep with both women and have
everybody be happy about it.
Leonard: Now we're getting somewhere.
Penny: What does your gut tell you?
Leonard: Go ask Penny; she'll know what to do.
%
Howard: You should've seen the look on your face!
Sheldon: Oh, yes. The slightly widened eyes of mildly surprised.
%
Sheldon: The German philosopher Frederick Nietzsche once said that
Morality is a fiction created by a herd of inferior men to hold back the
few superior men ... it's worth noting that he died of syphilis.
%
Sheldon: The only thing scary about that is the missing comma.
%
Sheldon: Yes, it's definitely a colonoscopy.
Leonard: My mother's coming for a visit.
Howard: Hey, what do you know. You were right.
%
Leonard: You shush! I'm happy. I want to talk about it!
%
Mrs. Hofstadter: If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out
what kind of cologne her father wore.
%
Mrs. Hofstadter: It might explain why the two of you have created an
ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.
*Pause*
Howard: Say what?
%
Leonard: That was fast.
Beverly: Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I'll have to try again later.
Sheldon: That's totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real
estate, it's location, location, location.
%
Leonard: (Talking about his mother) She's only been here a day and a half,
and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
Penny: Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday, and I've been half
bombed ever since.
%
Penny: (Talking about Leonard's mother) You can't let her get into your
head.
Leonard: It's too late for me, my head is her summer house.
%
Amy: Ears and genitalia.
Sheldon: Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about
environmental factors. Describe the scene for me?
Amy: I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette drinking
water. Carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny's friend Zack
stopped by and said 'hello' and I said 'whoo'.
Sheldon: Whoo?
Amy: Zack.
Sheldon: Then why did you ask?
Amy: Ask what?
Sheldon: Who?
Amy: Zack.
Sheldon: Alright, lets start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?
Amy: 'Whoo'.
Sheldon: Zack.
Amy: Why do you keep saying Zack?
Sheldon: Because you keep saying who?
Amy: I'm not saying whoo now, I said 'whoo' last night.
Sheldon: And the answer is Zack, correct?
Amy: There was no question, I simply said 'whoo'.
Sheldon: Alright I think I have enough to go on.
%
Sheldon: It's illegal to spay a human being.
%
Sheldon: Good grief. It's like talking to a dolphin.
%
Sheldon: What is the best number? By the way, there's only one correct
answer.
Raj: 5,318,008?
Sheldon: Wrong! The best number is 73. [Short silence] You're probably
wondering why.
Leonard & Howard: No no, we're good.
Sheldon: 73, is the 21st prime number, its mirror 37 is the 12th and its
mirror 21 is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, 7 and 3.
Did I lie?
Leonard: We did it! 73 is the... Chuck Norris of numbers!
Sheldon: Chuck Norris wishes! In binary, 73 is a palindrome, 1001001,
which backwards is 1001001, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris gets you
backwards is Sirron Kcuhc!
Raj: Just for the record, when you enter 5,318,008 in a calculator, upside
down it spells BOOBIES!

Amy Farrah Fowler: Did you know the iconic heart shape isn't based on an
actual human heart, its based on what a womans ass looks like bending
over.
Penny: So in 8th grade, I was dotting my i's with little asses? That's
cool.
%
(The guys are eating dinner.)
Sheldon: Clarify something for me. Isn't the point of a communal meal the
exchange of ideas and opinions, an opportunity to consider important
issues of the day?
Leonard: It is. You just kinda put a damper on things when you said, 'The
next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death'.
%
Leonard: 12 years after high school and I'm still at the nerd table.
%
Howard: How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
Raj: It's easy. The spider's crawling up your arm.
(Referring to Howard's bravery test to see which one is the sidekick.)
%
Sheldon: You know, in difficult times like this, I often turn to a force
stronger than myself.
Amy: Religion?
Sheldon: Star Trek.
%
Sheldon: Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.
Amy: Thank you, Sheldon. You are a good friend.
%
Penny: Are you saying that Amy is... Oh, what's the scientific word...
Sheldon: Forget science: she's horny.
%
Amy: Did you know that the iconic Valentine's heart shape is not actually
based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the
buttocks of a female bending over
Penny: Oh, so I spent 7th grade dotting my I's with asses? Cool.
%
Yes, this is doctor Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack JohnsOn that used to
have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. (to different
person) Hello I'm looking for a Zack Johnson that used to have coitus with
my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse and I have a feeling I'm
speaking to the right Zack.
%
Penny: Strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.
Sheldon: Strap on a pair of what ... skates?
Penny: Oh, you are so not the guy.
%
Sheldon: I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
Amy: I'm listening.
Sheldon: With the understanding that nothing changes what so ever -
physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing
you as not my girlfriend.
Amy: Interesting, now try it without the quadruple negative.
%
Sheldon: I believe I do, I'm the guy.
Penny: You're not the guy.
Sheldon: Are you sure? It would explain so much, your constant presence in
my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the
way you call me sweetie all the time.
Penny: I call everyone sweetie.
Sheldon: You tramp!
%
Amy: Goodnight, Stuart.
Stuart: Goodnight.
*Stuart and Amy hug*
Sheldon: (From inside Amy's apartment) Take the hint, Stuart, the lady
said goodnight!
%
Amy: I think a boy likes me!
Bernadette: Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?
Penny: She doesn't have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon.
%
Amy: Sheldon I'm disappointed, as a brilliant man you're entitled to a
vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow
man for sport, but this lame-o!
Sheldon: A, comic books employ story telling through sequential art, a
medium that dates back 17, 000 years to the cave paintings of Lasco and B,
you play the harp. Like that's cool.
%
Leonard: Hey, can I talk to you about something? It's a little awkward.
Sheldon: I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill
you're at, you're wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon
your research and focus on teaching. (pauses) Yes! And if I may suggest,
consider changing discipline, to the humanities or perhaps history. One of
the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create
things, you know, you just have to remember stuffs that happened and then
parrot it back. You can have fun with that
%
Leonard: Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.
Sheldon: Well of course he is. She's very interesting. Did you know, when
she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?
%
Sheldon: I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don't own Amy. You can't
own a person, at least not since?
*Leonard stares at him*
Sheldon: 1863. When President Lincoln freed the?
*Leonard looks fed up*
Sheldon: Slaves. Come on, Leonard. If you're gonna teach history, these
are the kind of facts you'll have to know.
Leonard: You know what, never mind.

Sheldon: Penny. '(Knocks 3 times)

Sheldon: Penny. (Knocks 3 times)
Penny: Who do we love?
Sheldon: Penny.

Howard: It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of
just downloading comics digitally.
Leonard: It's probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly
trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement to
change their sheets.
Howard: Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay!
%
Stuart: Can I help you find anything?
Amy: A comic that doesn't depict a woman whose bosom can be used as a
flotation device.
%
Howard: You interested in Amy?
Stuart: Well, I mean she didn't look through me with soul-sucking
ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman.

Bernadette: I'm too small for Twister. And, roller coasters. And sitting
with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.

Penny: Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool
and polyester.
%
Sheldon: I got a splinter.
Amy: What do you want me to do about it?
Sheldon: Relationship agreement - Section 4: Boo-boos and ouchies. You
have to take care of it.
Amy: I should've gotten a lawyer.
%
Amy: How did you get into my apartment?
Sheldon: Wow, is that the kind of nagging I should expect now that you're
my girlfriend?

Amy: (Reading Sheldon's relationship agreement) Section 5, Hand Holding:
Hand holding is only allowed under the following circumstances: A. ether
party is in danger of falling of a, cliff, precipice or ledge; B. ether
party is deserving of a hearty hand shake after winning a noble prize; C.
moral support during flu shots.

Sheldon: I present to you the Relationship Agreement. A binding covenant
that in its 31 pages enumerates, illuminates and codifies the
responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper (hereinafter referred to as the
"Boyfriend") and Amy Farrah Fowler (hereinafter referred to as the
"Girlfriend).
Amy: That's so romantic!
Sheldon: Mutual indemnification always is...

Rajesh: As with my father I both love and fear it.

Howard: Behold the Mobile Omni-Directional Neutralization and Termination
Eraticator! Or...
Leonard, Sheldon,Howard, Rajesh: (Said reverently) Mon-te...

Sheldon: This is an auspicious moment, like Robert Oppenhiemer or Neil

event.
Rajesh: How about, die toaster, die!

Rajesh: Die, Toaster, Die!

Wolowitz: As delicious as the appetizer may be, sooner or later we will
have to succumb and eat the entrée while it’s still…*licks finger and

Raj: Okay, what shall be the first to taste the wrath of MONTE?
Leonard: Maybe we should start small.
Raj: Okay, oh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what's inside
the Magic 8 Ball.
Sheldon: Did it when I was 4. It's an icosahedral die floating in tinted
blue water.
Raj: Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.
%
Sheldon: What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
Leonard: What did I do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still
punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd. You were
just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.
%
Penny: (To Howard) Normally, I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it.
You're a little peculiar. Like Sheldon.
Sheldon: Excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you're the one who's
peculiar.

Mrs. Wolowitz: Want me to get you a popsicle?
Howard: Cherry, please!
Mrs. Wolowitz: I ate the cherry. All that's left is green.
Howard: You make me wanna kill myself!

Raj: (Referring to Kripke's accent) I'm curious, what part of America is
that accent from?
%
Leonard: Remember the day we first met and you asked me to go to your
boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back? And he was 9 feet tall and he
took my pants off and you said-- What was that? What did you s--? Oh, yes,
you said you owed me one.
Penny: Oh, come on, that's not fair.
Leonard: I came home with no pants.

Sheldon: This place could really use a suggestion box.

Sheldon: Hawaii is a former Leaper Colony on top of an active Volcano
where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing,
Hawaii.

Sheldon: You've got the brilliant Sheldon Cooper in your lab and are going

(Penny talking to Sheldon & Howard at the Cheesecake Factory Bar.)
Penny: Hey, what you guys doing here?
Howard: We're grown men we drink at bars.
Penny: No and no.
(to Howard) Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
Howard: Oh yeah, SURE.
Penny: (to Sheldon) You and Amy? Good?
Sheldon: Oh, better than good.
Penny: You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it
happens?
Howard: I'm not signing a pre-nup.
Penny: All right Howard Wolowitz listen up! You sign anything she puts in
front of you. Because you are the luckiest man alive if you let her go
there is NO way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women,
it's not going to happen - we had a meeting.
%
Howard: Why don't I talk to him about it in May?
Bernadette: In May, you're gonna be on the International Space Station.
Howard: They got a phone.
%
Bernadette: And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don't bring up
Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican
II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or
the fact that you're Jewish.
%
Amy: Oh ... are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
Sheldon: No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence.

Sheldon: This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two
doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
Amy: Soap spots. Wash them again.

Amy: I'm excited to work with my boyfriend. It's going to be romantic.
Sheldon: Way to kill the mood.
%
Penny: So you're saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married,
you wouldn't sign a pre-nup?
Leonard: Absolutely not! If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while
you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling ... then Leonard gots
to get paid.
%
Bernadette: Oh, I don't know. I don't want to manipulate him with sex.
Penny: Oh, sweetie ... that's what sex is for.
%
Leonard: Lobster traps?
Sheldon: Yes. That's how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old
lighthouse.
%
Penny: You know I'm a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when
you're in bed with him. That's how I told my high school boyfriend I slept
with his brother. That's how I told his brother the same thing.
%
Sheldon: So, you're saying this is a regulation deck?
Howard: I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle!
%
Leonard: (To Penny) Nice to know everything's OK with your plumbing ...
err, the building's plumbing.

Rajesh: Why so glum, chum?
Sheldon: Apparently you can't hack into a government supercomputer and
then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security
tattling to your mother.

Leonard: Hypothetically, if I had access to a lieutenant Uhura uniform,
would you wear it?
Priya: Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my
brother has that outfit in his wardrobe.

from briefs to boxers, your testicles look a tad warm.

Sheldon: (Knocking on Penny's door early in the morning). Penny, Penny,
Penny!
(Penny opens the door).
Sheldon: Good morning.
Penny: Do you have any idea what time it is?
Sheldon: Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in
Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I'm
saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been
rhetorical.
%
Leonard: How long is [Toby/Leo] going to stay here?
Sheldon: He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard. Where's he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
%
Sheldon: I am uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.  
Leonard: What was I supposed to say?  
Sheldon: You could have told her the truth.
Leonard: I could not have said that, it would have hurt her feelings.
Sheldon: Is that a relevant factor?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
Leonard: What would I have said afterwards?
Sheldon: I would suggest something along the lines of "singing is neither
an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree, I
recommend you do a CAT scan to locate the tumor which is pressing on the
cognitive processing center of your brain".
%
Sheldon: Okay, then, riddle me this: Assuming all the good Terminators
were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed
by John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence,
bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year old killer robot?

Leonard: Ugh, this would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath!

Penny sing "Out Tonight"!
Leonard: What the hell is that?
Sheldon: I don't know, but if cats could sing ... they'd hate it too.
%
Penny: You'll never guess what just happened!
Leonard: Oh, I give up!
Sheldon: I don't guess! As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on
observations and experimentation. Although it occurs to me, you may have
been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard?
Leonard: Yes?
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and
I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight!
%
Sheldon: If she were to log on to

scroll down to seminars, download the PDF schedule, and look for the
seminar on molecular positroneum, well then, bippity boppity boo, our
pants are metaphorically on fire.
*Leonard shuts the door.*
Sheldon: Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.

Sheldon: (Knocking) Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard: Let it go, Sheldon. The murderer was the first mate whether it

Toby: DAMN YOU, CHAPLAIN HORRIGAN!
Penny: I'm sorry?
Toby: The Phillipines: 1992: The Subic Bay Naval Station: A young boy on
the cusp of manhood, his only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial
mosquitoes, desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to
introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but to instead introduced him to
a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he
have but to drink, shoot, and snort his pain away?
Sheldon: Don't forget genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Toby: That's never been proven.
Sheldon: There have been studies.
Toby: Not double-blind studies!
Sheldon: How could there be double-blind study? Who would be the control
group?
%
Sheldon: I'm fine. I'm no longer master of my own bladder.
%
Sheldon: I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own
bladder.........drat.

Penny: Born and raised.

user-friendly than Windows Vista......I don't like that.

Sheldon: It's not cartoons, it's anime!

Penny: I give up. He's impossible!
Sheldon: I can't be impossible; I exist! I think what you meant to say is,
'I give up; he's improbable'.

Penny: Oh man, did the KISS Army repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell?
%
Wolowitz: They're called tattoo sleeves... Put them on, have freaky sex
with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can
still be buried in a Jewish cemetary.
%
Wolowitz: Yes, she's pushy, and yes, he's whipped -- but that's not the
expression.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat!
Sheldon: Actually, it turns out I can.

Sheldon: Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify
behavior. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.

*In tattoo salon*.
Girl: What are you gonna get, Raj?
Raj: With my luck - Hepatitis!
%
Sheldon: You know, I've always wanted to go to a goth nightclub.
Howard: Really?
Sheldon: Bazinga! You never see any of my practical jokes coming, do you?
%
Leonard: I'm just saying, you catch more flies with honey then with
vinegar.
Sheldon: You catch even more with manure, what's your point?
%
Leonard: They're gonna get beaten up at that club.
Penny: They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens.

Sheldon: Penny, while I subscribe to the "Many Worlds" theory which posits
the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of
universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
%
Leonard: I know what your doing.
Sheldon: You do?
Leonard: You're using chocolate as a positive reinforcement for what you
consider is a correct behavior!
Sheldon: Very good! Chocolate?

Penny: I think we'll pass.
Howard: Oh, is the Mrs speaking for the couple now?
Leonard: In this case, you bet she is!
%
Penny: Ok, who wants syrup & who wants powdered sugar?
Sheldon: I want oatmeal.
Penny: Well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a big pain in the
ass.
Sheldon: I'm sure you'll have that soon enough.
%
Sheldon: (Smelling french toast) That does smell good, (throwing away
toast) too bad it's Monday.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, you need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
Sheldon: What am I supposed to do? Eat French Toast on a Monday? Now that
would be impossible.

%
Amy: We need to fabricate a tantalising piece of gossip.
Sheldon: And a second non-tantalising piece to use as a control.
Amy: Then we'll track its progress through our social group and interpret
the results through the competing academic prisms of mimetic theory,
algebraic gossip and epidemiology.
Sheldon: Look at you, getting me to engage in the Social Sciences. You're
a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler!
%
Sheldon: Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
%
Sheldon: That's going to make me a chick magnet and I'm so busy as it is!
%
Sheldon: I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you has
given me a great deal of satisfaction.

Sheldon: If you don't mind, I'd like to stop listening to you and start
talking.

Sheldon: Doctor Greene, question?
Dr. Greene: Yes?
Sheldon: You've dedicated your lifes work to educate the general populus
about complex sciencific ideas.
Dr. Greene: Yes, in part.
Sheldon: Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps
reading to the elderly?
Dr. Greene: Excuse me?
Sheldon: Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid of
course, big fan.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us
recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part too!
%
Leonard: Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
Penny: Of course I heard about it, how did you hear about it?
Leonard: I heard it from Sheldon, he got it from Amy.
Penny: Damn it! I told Amy that in the strictest of confidence. Boy some
people are such blabbermouths. Well whatever, I'm sure Bernadette can do
better.
Leonard: Do you think a sexually ambivelent Indian astrophysicist with
selected mutism and alcohol issues is better than a 100 lb Jewish guy who
lives with his mom?
Penny: You are kidding! Raj likes Bernadette?
Leonard: I didn't say Raj, who said Raj?
Penny: Okay give, how do you know? Did he tell you?
Leonard: No
Penny: Well then who?
Leonard: I can't say
Penny: Priya told you, oh what a little gossip. Ya know, not an attractive
quality in a woman Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.
Leonard: Well the point is if this got out it would destroy Howard and
Raj's friendship.
Penny: You don't have to worry, unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a
secret.
Leonard: You're the one who told Amy in the first place.
Penny: In confidence!
%
Howard: Oh great it's my cousin David about the ring... Hey David what'd
you find?... Sure half a carat is fine, her freakishly small hands make
anything look big. It's one of the reasons I love her.
%
Raj: Shut your ass!
%
Sheldon: Interesting! So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow
by blow account, as it were.
Amy: Pun intended?
Sheldon: I'm sorry, what pun?
%
Sheldon: What an elf I would've made.
%
Amy: The meme has reached full penetration.
Sheldon: Pun intended?
Amy: No. Happy accident.
%
Penny: All right, try thinking about this -- Sheldon and Amy had sex.
Raj: Shut your ass!
%
Raj: It's amazing what liquor does to guilt.
%
Sheldon: I'm no stanger to mimetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary
school, the phrase Shelly Cooper's a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.
Amy: I should think so, that's gold.
%
Raj: Besides, if you might not know, Bernadette is planing to break up
with Howard!
Penny: I know that, how do you know that?
Raj: My sister told me.
Penny: That gossipy bitch! No offence.
Raj: Non taken, you should hear how she talks about you.
%
Leonard: Hope, you're hungry!
Sheldon: Interesting, a friendly sentiment in this country - a cruel taunt
in the Sudan...
%
Sheldon: I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom is our
living room and just outside our living room is that hallway and
immediately adjacent to that hallway is [Penny's messed up apartment]!
Leonard: Do you realize if Penny wakes up there's no reasonable
explanation to why we are here?
Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be
determined by a jury of your peers.
%
Leonard: If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for
Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
Sheldon: You're kidding, right?
%
Leonard: I guess we'll just take [a TV cabinet] up [the stairs] ourselves.
Sheldon: We don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable
upper-body strength.
Leonard: We don't need strength. We're physicists. We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever, and I can move
the Earth. (Trying to move the box) It's just a matter of... I don't have
this. I don't have this. I don't have it!
Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.
%
Sheldon: Oh Gravity, thou art a heartless b*tch.
%
Leonard: Most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
fiber content.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
%
Leonard (trying to get Sheldon to leave Penny's apartment in the middle of
the night): Sheldon, this is not your home!
Sheldon: This isn't anyone's 'home'. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
%
Leonard: For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): You have a sarcasm sign?
%
Leonard (looking at the heavy box and the stairs): Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a Power Ring.

Howard (to Leonard, after a round of Dance Dance Revolution): Grab a

Howard: Been there!

Penny: Yes, I know men can't fly.
Sheldon: No, no let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling,
accelerating at an initial rate of 32ft per second, per second. Superman
swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Ms. Lane, who
is now traveling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is
immediately sliced into three. equal pieces.

Sheldon: Ah, gravity - thou art a heartless bitch.

Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?

Sheldon: If you have time to lean you have time to clean.

Sheldon: Pfffft.
Leonard: What's funny?
Sheldon: Wasn't sarcasm?
Leonard: No!

Leonard: You convinced me. Maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo
her carpet.

Leonard: Yes... For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm
sign every time I open my mouth?
Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?

%
Sheldon: I love my mind.
%
Leonard: Some kind of nerd?. I'm the king of nerds.
Penny: What does that mean?
Leonard: It means that if someone makes me mad, I won't help them set up
their printer.
%
Sheldon: Oh no, they sent the wrong Spock. Live long and suck it, Zachary
Quinto!
%
Leonard: What are you afraid of?
Penny: Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you
again.
Leonard: What if I dump you?
Penny: [Scoffs] Come on, be serious.
%
Leonard: Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the
bugs, and if we both think it is solid, we roll it out to the public.
%
Leonard: How does a miserable date end in sex?
Penny: I don't know, it's complicated.
Leonard: Well, I'm a pretty smart guy and right now my brain has dibs on
the blood supply so give it a go.
%
Leonard: No, just you and me.
Penny: Have you thought this through?
Leonard: Yes, and I think we should go anyway.
%
Bernadette: Boy, I don't know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke
up.
Howard: Why not?
Bernadette: I'm a very vengeful person.
Howard: Really?
Bernadette: With access to weaponized smallpox.
%
Sheldon: Now, back to our game.
Raj: You were in the middle of an erection.
Sheldon: Oh, of course. It's right here in my hand.
%
Sheldon: And now that I have some wood. I'm going to begin the erection of
my settlement.
%
Raj: Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took two years and defiling
my sister to turn that frown upside down.
Leonard: I didn't defile your sister, we had a relationship.
Raj: I heard you called her Brown Sugar. In my book, that's defilement.
%
Penny: You mean, like a date?
Leonard: Not like a date, a date.
%
*Raj whispers in Leonard's ear*
Leonard: No! You can't watch Bridget Jones' Diary!
%
Sheldon: Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle
finger.
%
Amy: Travel makes me constipated so I am the ideal hotel room-mate.
%
Leonard: (To Raj) I'd like to kick your little brown ass.
%
Wolowitz: What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?
%
Sheldon: We are only as strong as our weakest bladder.
%
Sheldon: I need to sleep here tonight.
Rajesh: Why?
Sheldon: Howard is a total ass, Bernadette is in Penny's bed, Amy bites
and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.
Rajesh: OK, come in.
%
Amy: Are you in the lanthanoid series?
Sheldon: Amy, it's Penny's turn! Penny...
Penny: Uh, I dunno. Are you food?
Sheldon: That's not a apropos! We've already established I'm found on the
Periodic Table.
Penny: Well, it's a table, right? I mean, why can't there be food on it?
Sheldon: I knew she wasn't lead car material!
%
Sheldon: Good morning everyone and welcome to "Science and Society". I'm
Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD and ScD. OMG, right?
%
Leonard: Yeah, that would be a little more like getting into dracula's
coffin.
%
Sheldon: Raj! What are you doing?
Raj: *raises coffee cup*
Sheldon: I don't think so! You've already had your allotted 6 ounces. The
next bathroom break isn't until the Dennys near Bakersfield, which is
approximately 2 and a half hours away. Remember people, we're only as
strong as our weakest bladder.
%
Leonard: Black beans, not pinto beans?
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: Double guacamole?
Sheldon: Of course.
Leonard: Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: You understand why I'm doing this?
Sheldon: I do.
Leonard: That will be all.
%
Sheldon: Captain hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile not an alligator. If
you're going to insult me at least get your facts straight.
%
Sheldon: You can try, but you'll never catch me. Bazinga!
%
Sheldon (to himself): Structure, constant structure, one atom...
Howard: Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?
Leonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
Howard: I thought I smelled popcorn!
%
Sheldon: Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I
noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back.
Penny: Leonard doesn't snore.
Sheldon: I wasn't talking to Leonard.
Leonard (to Penny): Told ya.
%
Penny: Whatcha doin'?
Sheldon: I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so
as to engage the superior coliculus of my brain.
Penny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. Have you been up all
night?
Sheldon: Is it morning?
Penny: Yes....
Sheldon: Then I've been up all night.
%
Raj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I'm very
unhappy that you turned it into a double date. I hope you both fall on
your asses and break your coccyxes.
Sheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
Raj: Screw you, give me back my lima beans.
%
Howard: How long has he been stuck?
Leonard: Hmm, intellectually about 30 hours, emotionally about 29 years.
%
Penny: What happened?
Leonard: Sheldon's escaped and he's terrorizing the village.
%
Sheldon: And you can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build
carbon atoms!
Leonard: No, I don't think so. We need to go home now.
Sheldon: But I'm still working!
Leonard: If you don't come out of there, I'm gonna have to drag you out.
Sheldon: You can try...but you'll never catch me. (dives into ball pit)
%
Leonard: Penny, I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night, he
just runs around the apartment.
%
Bernadette: Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
Sheldon: I don't know, 2/3 days, not important. I don't need sleep, I need
answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas
squatteth the toad of truth.
Penny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
Leonard: No, that's a crazy thing.
%
Sheldon: I'm not Sheldon! I'm the Flash! And now I'm going to the Grand
Canyon to scream in frustration *takes two quick steps* I'm back
%
Sheldon: I'm sorry, but in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
%
Sheldon: I understand why you're upset. You're afraid that costume makes
you look fat.
%
Sheldon: Don't worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be
very beefy gals.
%
Wolowitz: You got her to have sex with you. Obviously your super power is
brainwashing.
%
Zack: You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out
if you kill a starfish it'll just come back to life.
Sheldon: Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have
been watching Nickelodeon.
%
Sheldon: Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild
flavor, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
%
Sheldon: Amy Farah Fowler doesn't do costumes. She's not the free spirit I
am.
%
Zack: You're inferring I'm stupid.
Sheldon: That's not correct. We implied you're stupid, you then inferred
it.
%
Sheldon: Good Lord how you frustrate me Leonard Hofstadter!
%
Sheldon: (Knocking at Penny's door) Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny!
Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny! Penny!
Penny: What are you doing Sheldon?!
Sheldon: I'm the Flash, I just knocked 30 thousand times.
%
Raj: I've said before, and I'll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
%
Koothrappali: Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a
skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny,
tiny Dark Knight.
Sheldon: Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice
but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
Koothrappali: Ooh, I call Kermit.
Sheldon: I'm Kermit. You're Scooter.
Koothrappali: Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He's the Aquaman of the Muppet
Babies.
%
Wolowitz: Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.
Sheldon: Oh.
Koothrappali: Yes.
Sheldon: What's the bad news?
Wolowitz: Superman probably isn't getting laid tonight.
Zack: Aw, damn.
%
Zack: Hold on. The costume came with a black wig.
Penny: No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.
Zack: Come on. We're trying to win a contest here.
Penny: Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.
Zack: Honey, there is no "I" in "Justice League."
%
Raj: Water Demon.
Howard: Ice Dragon.
Leonard: Lesser Warlord of Ka*a.
Sheldon: Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
Leonard: Infinite Sheldon?
Sheldon: Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not
violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
Leonard: Do you understand why people don*t want to play with you?
Sheldon: No, although it*s a question I*ve been pondering since preschool.
%
Zack: You want to go with *em?
Penny: No.
Zack: Okay, see you later.
Penny: Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you*re ditching me to go look at comic
books?
Zack: Are you mad at me?
Penny: I*m not happy.
Zack: Milk Dud?
%
Zack: Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?
Sheldon: In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.
Zack: Oh, no, you're thinking old-school Archie. It%u2019s much more
sophisticated now. Like, there's two universes, and Archie's married to
Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with
Moose.
Raj: No.
Zack: About time, right?
Stuart: Hey.
Zack: Hey.
Stuart: You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
Leonard: Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He%u2019s a friend of ours. Zack, this
is Stuart. He owns the store.
Zack: Wow, lucky you.
Stuart: Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an
hour.
Zack: Sweet.
Stuart: Is that sarcasm?
Howard: Uh, no, it's an indictment of the American education system.
Raj: The Archies are over here.
Zack: Yippee.
%
Stuart: So are you guys coming to my New Year%u2019s Eve costume party?
Sheldon: Of course. We%u2019re coming as the Justice League of America.
Howard: Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League
of America.
Sheldon: To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity
to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is
clearly Leonard as Superman.
Leonard: Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
Sheldon: That%u2019s sad. Let%u2019s ask ourselves, is there anyone we
know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?
Stuart: Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard's mother in
high-heeled boots?
Sheldon: I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving
his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
Leonard: Zack?
Howard: He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
Leonard: You can%u2019t replace me with Zack.
Sheldon: Why not? Penny did it.
Howard: Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn%u2019t we be?
Zack: Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set
for my weekend number twos.
Sheldon: Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?
Zack: I don't know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.
%
Leonard: Fine, if Zack's going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.
Raj: But I'm Green Lantern.
Leonard: You can be Aquaman.
Raj: I don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks
fish pee.
Sheldon: Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to
request the fish do their business elsewhere.
Zack: Hey, babe.
Penny: I'm still mad at you.
Zack: Well, you won't be when you hear the great news.
Penny: What great news?
Zack: We're going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year's
Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.
Sheldon: Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible
plane sold separately.
%
Penny: Wait, why me? Wh-Why can*t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
Howard: She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas
party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to
contain yellow fever.
Penny: Okay, what about your friend Amy?
Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler doesn*t believe in wearing costumes. She isn*t
the free spirit I am.
%
Howard: I'm Batman.
Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his
crime-fighting cohorts when he's running late.
Howard: I had to walk. I couldn't get Raj on the back of my scooter.
Raj: I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
%
Zack: Look up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. I forget the rest.
Penny: All right. Let's get this thing over with.
Sheldon: I'm sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
Howard: Relax. No one's going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.
Zack: Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?
Penny: No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.
Zack: Come on. We're trying to win a contest here.
Penny: Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.
Zack: Penny, there's no I in Justice League.
Howard: Well, actually...
Sheldon: Don't. He's making our case.
Zack: Okay, babe. You're kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.
Penny: Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm not going.
%
Zack: (At Penny's door) Babe, open up.
Penny: I'm not talking to you.
Zack: Then who are you talking to? Babe?
%
Sheldon: Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice
but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
Raj: Ooh, I call Kermit.
Sheldon: I'm Kermit. You're Scooter.
Raj: Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
%
Howard: No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.
Leonard: What makes you think I can convince her?
Howard: You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is
brainwashing.
Leonard: Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my
ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we
can win a stupid prize?
Sheldon: Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
%
Leonard: You think Penny's right? Were we bullying Zack?
Howard: No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was
underpants-free.
Raj: And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
Leonard: That happened to you?
Raj: First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my
eyes.
Leonard: I don't know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.
Howard: So go apologize.
Leonard: Why me?
Howard: You started it, we just piled on.
Leonard: What would I even say?
Sheldon: Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid. Have a Milk Dud.
Raj: A Milk Dud?
Sheldon: Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably
mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
Leonard: I got a better idea. We*re all responsible. I say we all go. Come
on, who's with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might
get punched. You really want to miss that?
Raj: Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
Sheldon: You're embarrassing yourself.
%
Sheldon: Good lord how you frustrate me Leonard Hofstadter!
%
Zack: I don't get it.
Leonard: A dolphin might.
%
Penny: Holy crap on a cracker!
%
Ramona: You are so witty!
Sheldon: Aren't I?
%
Sheldon: Who's Nowitzki?
Ramona: I'm Nowitzki!
Sheldon: Oh, so you want me to share credit with you?
Ramona: Uh huh!
Sheldon: GET OUT!
%
Leonard: Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
Sheldon: It's a waste of time. I might as well explain thermodynamics to a
bunch of Labradoodles.
Leonard: If you don't do this, I won't take you to the comic book store.
%
Howard: You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz liquid-waste-disposal system is
turning a few heads as well.
Ramona: Again, Ew!
%
Leonard: That's it, no more Thai food.
%
Leonard: So if you are considering going into experimental physics, my
door is always open. Once again, I'm sorry that the demonstration didn't
quite work out. But now we know what happens when you accidentally spill
peach snapple into a helium-neon laser. The short answer is don't.
%
Sheldon: (To the class) Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember
when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of
course, I was 14 and had already achieved more than you could ever hope
to, despite my 9:00 bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this
room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics. It's more
likely that you will spend your careers teaching fifth graders how to make
paper-mache volcanoes with baking-soda lava.
Leonard: Oh, good God.
Sheldon: In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to
make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you.
A cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future
of science. Now, if you'll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out.
Come, Leonard.
Leonard: (To class) Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?
%
Raj: I love this time of the year, the leaves are turning, there's a
bracing chill in the air.
Howard: Plus there's a whole new crop of female grad students about to put
on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That's
right, honey, have another calzone. Daddy can wait.
%
Raj: Isn't there a policy against dating graduate students?
Leonard: No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
Raj: Damn, there's always a catch.
%
Leonard: Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined forks.
Sheldon: Three tines is not a fork. Three tines is a trident. Forks are
for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.
%
Ramona: Didn't a great man once say, "Science demands nothing less than
the fervent and unconditional dedication of our entire lives."?
Sheldon: He did!
Ramona: And who was that great man?
Sheldon: Me! Sorry, Leonard.
Leonard: Seriously? You're not coming?
Sheldon: You heard her. How can I argue with me?
%
Sheldon: (To Penny) Apparently, I'm in some kind of relationship, and,
well, you seem to be an expect at ending them.
Penny: Excuse me?
Sheldon: I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
Penny: Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.
%
Sheldon: (asking Penny not to think of Leonard as a sexual partner) I
would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.
Penny: I could think about you ...
Sheldon: Whatever works.
%
Sheldon: *knock knock knock* Leonard? *knock knock knock* Leonard? *knock
knock knock* Leonard?
Leonard: *opens door* What Sheldon! What Sheldon! What Sheldon!
Sheldon: Tell me what you see here. (Holding his laptop.)
Leonard: The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
%
Sheldon: If I'm permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win!
%
Raj: (kind of a squeak)Ooo!
Penny: What's the matter, Lassie? Did Timmy fall down the well?
%
Sheldon: Of the handful of women Leonard's been involved with, she's the
only one I have ever found tolerable.
Penny: Well, what about me?
Sheldon: The statement stands for itself.
%
Penny: I'll tell you what happened. (sigh) We were young. We were very
much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-travelling
mailbox at my lake house.
Sheldon: It's not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you
mock me with it?
%
Leonard: You hacked my Facebook account?
Sheldon: Oh, it's hardly hacking when you use the same password for
everything, Kal-El.
%
Sheldon: I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. It-- When I was
Stephanie: What? What happened?
Sheldon: Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own CAT
scanner.
Stephanie: I'm sorry, you tried to build your own CAT scanner?
Sheldon: No, I didn't try, I succeeded.
%
Sheldon: Well, this is very pleasant.
Leonard: I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
Sheldon: And you said there would never be enough pasta for the three of
us.
%
Sheldon: What's your favorite fruit?
Stephanie: Strawberries!
Sheldon: Mm, technically not a fruit, but all right.
%
Sheldon: If you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will,
then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always
needed.
Leonard: What landing party?
Sheldon: You're Kirk, I'm Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the
guy who always gets killed. (referring to Stephanie) And now we've got
McCoy.
%
Sheldon: This is banana bread.
Penny: This is a door knob.
%
Howard: Don't spritz him (Leonard) with that body spray from the
commercials where the women undress when they smell it? That doesn't work
at all. No matter how much you put on.
%
Leonard: (after breaking white asparagus jar) I'm bleeding!
Sheldon: Like a gladiator.
%
Sheldon: I'd like to have a talk about relationships.
(Howard looks At Raj)
Raj: You were supposed to have the talk with him!
%
Leonard: I don't think I can go to the North Pole.
Sheldon: OK, Leonard, I know you're concerned about disappointing me, but
I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you
are very low.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants
you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.
Leonard: You really think so?
Sheldon: Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed to
pull off another one of my classic pranks. BAZINGA!
%
Raj: My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in
the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I'm reborn as a
well-hung billionaire with wings!
%
Leonard: Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds
the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
Howard: I could also be the engineer that builds the crossbow that kills
Sheldon.
%
Raj: Is [inviting us to the North Pole] just so we won't touch your stuff
while you're away?
Sheldon: I'll admit that was a concern, but the fact is I'll need a
support team, and the three of you are my first choice.
Howard: Really?
Sheldon: Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the
thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache.
%
Sheldon: Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at 8:00 and move
my bowels at 8:20.
Leonard: Yes, how did we live before Twitter?
%
Howard: Easy. Instead of saying; 'No we don't wanna go on an NSF
expedition,' say; 'No we don't wanna spend three months stuck in a cabin
in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag!'
%
Sheldon: This is to train for a 3 months expedition to the magnetic North
Pole.
Penny: What?!
Sheldon: I don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you,
[pause] but to elaborate, I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard,
Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
%
Sheldon: Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the Planet
Hoth? No, he opened a Ton Ton to keep his body temperature from
plummeting.
Howard: You heard the man, hold him down and I'll cut him open.
%
Sheldon: *Speaking on the phone to his mother* Mommy, I love you. Don't
let Spock take me to the future.
%
Raj: Dance number aside, I'm so not gay.
%
Sheldon: I agreed to speak to you this evening because I was told that
you're the best and the brightest of this University's doctoral
candidates.
%
Hmm. Course, that's saying you're the most important electron in a
hydrogen atom. *Heh* 'Cause you see, there's only 1 electron in a hydrogen
atom. *Silence* Best and brightest my sweet patootee.
%
Penny: Mrs Cooper? Hey, it's Penny. I think I broke your son. Hold on. (To
Sheldon) Talk to your mother.
Sheldon: (Crying) Mummy, I love you. Don't let Spock take me to the
future!
%
Raj: I know the feeling. It's like accidentally walking into a gay bar and
then having no one hit on you. It happened to a friend of mine!
%
Raj: Cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal. Like a
labradoodle!
%
Sheldon: I was expecting applause but I suppose stunned silence is equally
appropriate.
%
Sheldon: I sense that you're trying to slow walk me to an epiphany. Would
you mind very much jumping to it.
%
Penny: (Reading tweet) "Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me wanna start
cutting myself again."
%
Sheldon: Well, I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion. I think
I'll turn in. (heading to bed) I didn't wanna teach those poopy heads
anyway.
Howard: FYI, I think that's what Darth Vader said just before he started
building the Death Star.
%
Penny: Ok, Sheldon, I think that we should try to get you out of your
comfort zone.
Sheldon: Why would we do that? It's named for a reason.
Penny: Well, maybe, you could play your mother, and I could play Spock.
Sheldon: *His right eye twitching visibly, catch in his throat* You'll...
play... Spock?!
%
Sheldon: (To Penny) Hey, you taught me something, who would have thought
that.
%
Sheldon: The two of you need to get your women in line!
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Last night I was strong armed into an evening of harp music and
spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler, this on a night that I had
originally designated for solving the space time geometry in higher spin
gravity and building my lego death star ... and why? Because your gal pals
Penny and Bernadette went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without
Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would
affect me, the future of string theory, or my lego fun time!
Howard: What do you want us to do about it?
Sheldon: You clearly weren't listening to my
topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and
set things right! I am a man of science not someone's snuggle bunny!
Leonard: Why do I have to talk to Penny? She's not my girlfriend.
Sheldon: You invited her to lunch 4 years ago. Everything about her is on
you, you make it so!
%
Amy: Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady. And, with that comes an
estrogen- fueled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me
hate my body.
%
Amy: Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.
%
(Amy & Sheldon are awkwardly cuddling.)
Amy: I'm just saying, second base is right there.
%
Amy: At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical
contact.
Sheldon: Oh, boy.
%
Sheldon: I can't seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video
chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall,texting her, nothing.
Leonard: Did you try calling her on the telephone?
Sheldon: The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may
be the wisest of us all.
%
Leonard: Come on, she's your friend.....step up! [knock] Amy. [knock] Amy.
[knock] Amy. (turns to leave) Bye!
Sheldon: Where are you going?
Leonard: I'm single. I don't need this crap!
%
Sheldon: New topic: women. Delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?
%
Wolowitz: Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are
looking particularly ravishing today.
Penny: Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.
Wolowitz: So there is a number.
%
Sheldon: Do those sound like castanets to you?
Leonard: The box says 'kitchen'.
Sheldon: So? Do cocaine smugglers write 'cocaine' on the box?
%
Sheldon: Listen to that! 'Stomp, stomp, stomp.' It's Wolowitz and his
stacked heels that fool no one.
%
Wolowitz: According to Alicia's Facebook page, she's hooking up with one
of the producers on CSI.
Penny: Dead whore on TV, live one in real life.
%
Leonard: The box says "kitchen."
Sheldon: So? Do cocaine smugglers write "cocaine" on the box?
%
*Penny enter the house without knocking*
Penny: Hello there.
Sheldon: Who is it? Hello, Penny. It's open, come in..... Sarcasm.
%
Sheldon: Please. We're facing a far more serious problem than stray
arachnids.
Leonard: It's not so bad.
Sheldon: Not bad? It's horrible. You hear stories about this things, but
you never think it'll happen to you.
Leonard:So they steamed your dumplings. Get over it.
%
Penny: They aren't like other guys. They're Special
Alicia: Okay, they're special and..?
Penny: Well let's see how can I explain this. Um. They don't know how to
use their shields.
Alicia: Shields?
Penny: Yeah, You know like in Star Trek and you're in battle, and you
raise the shields.
*Realizing what she said* Where the hell did that come from?
%
Sheldon: Change is never fine, they say it is, but it's not.
Penny: Okay, did you even know the people that are moving out?
Sheldon: I never met them. That's what made them perfect. There were no
awkward hellos in the halls. There's no clickety-clackety of high-heel
shoes on hardwood floors. They may as well have been a family of cats just
jumping around from drape to drape. And without that annoying
ammonia-urine smell.
%
Sheldon: (Imitating Admiral Ackbar) It's a trap!
%
Howard: Shucks means Shucks, let one go once in a while.
%
Sheldon: (Sarcastic) Who is it? Oh, hello, Penny. It's open. Come in. (To
Penny) Sarcasm!
%
Sheldon: You set it on DTS, didn't you?
Leonard: I had to, she called me cutie.
%
Leonard: How about that, Einstein was wrong.
Penny: What?
Leonard: Approaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time,
approaching them [Howard and his date] does.
%
Wil Wheaton: Did that guy [Sheldon] just say "Revenge is a dish best
served cold" to me in Klingon?
%
Wil Wheaton: Game over, Moonpie.
%
Wolowitz: Puppies, how do you stand on puppies?
Bernadette: A puppy once bit my face!
Wolowitz: Of course it did.
%
Rajesh: What are you waiting for?! Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell's heart,
stab at him!
%
Wil Wheaton: What's wrong with him (Sheldon)?
Stuart: Everybody has a different theory.
%
Bernadette: My mother wouldn't let me ride a bicycle because she was
afraid I might hit a bump and lose my virginity.
%
Sheldon: Die, Wil Wheaton, die!
%
Leonard: What am I supposed to ask her? 'Hey Penny, you got any friends
that you never want to talk to again?
%
Sheldon: From Hell's heart, I stab at thee!
%
Sheldon: Now Fetch Me Will Wheaton! (SPEAKING KLINGON)
Wil Wheaton: Did that guy just say, "Revenge is a dish best served cold,"
in Klingon?
Stuart: I believe so.
Wil Wheaton: What is wrong with him?
Stuart: Everyone has a different theory.
%
Leonard: A long time ago, I made a deal with Howard involving you.
Penny: Okay, I don't know where this is going, but tread carefully,
because this may be the last conversation we ever have.
%
Penny: The great thing about Ernie (Sesame Street Puppet) is that he
didn't ask for anything, he just gave.
%
Howard: All right, Raj has played his Phantom Warlord card and I am going
to back him up with my strangling vines. (Playing card, making gesture to
Leonard) Choke on that, sucker.
%
Leonard: Then I'll just cut your vines with my Ruby Sword. (Playing card,
making gesture to Howard) That's right, I did it, I cut them.
%
Penny: (About the cards) I got a question.
Leonard: Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and
basically everything beats Enchanted Bunny.
Howard: Unless you have the carrot of power.
Penny: Okay, I've got another question. When does this get fun?
%
Leonard: Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
Sheldon: "Photographic" is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I've
told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon
of May 7th. You had turkey and complained it was dry.
%
Leonard: (To Howard) When I made that agreement, I didn't think I'd ever
have a hot girlfriend, and I was positive you never would.
%
Raj: How come I wasn't part of this deal?
Sheldon: You had left the refreshment stand in prder to indulge in your
customary preemptive pre-show urination.
Raj: So, that's how it works? I have a teeny bladder and I don't get a hot
girlfriend.
Howard: Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.
Raj: Damn!
%
Leonard: Can I have a napkin.
Sheldon: I'm sorry, no!
Leonard: But you have a whole bunch of napkins.
Sheldon: Yes, I've moved to a four napkin system, lap, hands, face, and
personal emergency. If you like, starting tomorrow, I'll add a guest
napkin but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.
*Leonard grabs a napkin.*
Sheldon: Good luck, that's the face napkin.
%
Raj: Hey, Sheldon, guess what I've heard today.
Sheldon: I'd imagine you heard any number of things today. When you
arrived at work, you undoubtedly heard: Hello, Raj; How are you, Raj; and
given you're wearing a new sweater vest, you may have heard: "New Sweater
Vest" and possible, though less likely "Nice Sweater Vest."
%
Leonard: You know deep down inside, Howard's a nice guy.
Penny: The problem isn't what's on the inside. It's the creepy candy
coating.
%
Sheldon: (To Stuart) I can buy all these things online, I come here for
the personal service.
%
Sheldon:Excuse me, are you saying that Wil Wheaton, a.k.a. Ensign Wesley
Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation, is going to be participating in
your tournament?
Stuart: I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that
for yourself?
Sheldon: No, wait, you don't understand, growing up, I idolized Wil
Wheaton, you know, Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
Raj: Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while
you're playing in the tournament. Sign here.
Sheldon: Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995, I traveled 10 hours by bus
to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi wearing my Starfleet
Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to
autograph my mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
Raj: Oh, It'll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
Sheldon: (Mood changes) Yeah, my arduous journey, however, was for naught.
Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment I
vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
Raj: Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him, sign here.
Sheldon: It might interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks
6th on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher,
who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who
lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my
bicycle.
%
Sheldon: In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal Wrath of Khan:
"He tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him."
Raj: No doubt! Sign here.
Sheldon: (Signing) "From hell's heart, I stab at thee."
%
Howard: How about computers? You like computers?
Bernadette: I use them, I don't like them.
%
Bernadette: Does your mother call you everyday to see if you had a healthy
lunch?
Howard: My mother calls me everyday to see if I had a healthy bowel
movement.
%
Howard: (To Bernadette) A Catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like
that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I've been hoping
for.
%
Sheldon: The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi, having spent
against relieving myself onboard a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at
the 4th annual Dixie Trek Convention only to find that my idol, Wil
Wheaton, decided he had better thing to do than show up and sign my action
figure.
Wil Wheaton: What?!
Sheldon: You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton, now I have my revenge.
%
Sheldon: Today, I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to... You know,
that other guy.
Howard: Antonio Salieri?
Sheldon: Oh God, now even you are smarter than me.
%
Howard: Hey, I'm damaged, too. How about a hug for Howie?
%
Sheldon: Engineering. Where the noble semiskilled laborers execute the
vision of those who think and dream. Hello, Oompa-Loompas of science.
%
Dr. Gablehauser: Okay, well, speaking of spreads, we're having a small
welcoming party this afternoon for Mr. Kim who's agreed to join us here at
the university.
Sheldon: Of course he has. The Oracle told us little Neo was the one. You
can see the matrix, can't you?
%
Howard: I know the type. Cheerleader, student council, goes out with the
jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program. If after 2 years
of begging, she agrees to go out with you, it turns out to be a setup and
you're in your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team
laughs at you *sobbing*.
%
Rajesh: Why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to
move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her
for months on end.
Leonard: Okay, that was uncalled for.
Rajesh: You started it, dude.
%
Howard: I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new
sexy.
Leonard: Then why do we go home alone every night? We're still smart.
Rajesh: Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's off-putting.
%
Raj: Can you believe it! He watched me work for 10 minutes and than he
tried to build a little peace of software that could replace me!
Leonard: Is that really possible?
Raj: As it turned out, yes.
%
Leonard: Ok. Sheldon, I understand that you are going through a career
crisis. You're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable
and productive, but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen
carefully.
Sheldon: Alright.
Leonard: GO AWAY!
%
Penny:I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first
place?
Howard:We like Leonard!
%
Howard: It's a small, brown paper bag, ma, I'm looking at it right now.
Why would I make that up? There's no Ding Dong in it. How are two Ding
Dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?
%
Howard: Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have masters
in engineering.
Sheldon: And you also have a note from your mother that says "I love you,
Bubula" but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over
nano-tubes.
%
Sheldon: It's like from the baseball movie, "If you build it, they will
come."
Gablehauser: Who will come?
Sheldon: The Jewish People!
Gablehauser: What if they don't come?
Sheldon: We'll make it nice, put out a spread.
%
Sheldon: I don't understand your objection, Professor Goldfarb. Why
wouldn't the Sonora Desert make a perfectly good Promised Land?
Goldfarb: Go away!
Sheldon:We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.
Goldfarb: Please go away!
Sheldon: Said Pharaoh to Moses!
%
Leonard: Sure, if he wants to spend years doing her homework while she
drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians and you're the
one holding her head while she's puking and telling you she wishes more
guys were like you. And then she gets into Cornell, because you wrote her
essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like
she doesn't even know you.
%
Sheldon: Ladies and Gentlemen, honored daughters, while Mr. Kim by virtue
of his youth and naivete has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for
human contact, let me assure you that my research will go on
uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and
repulse me. Thank you!
%
Howard: Unbelievable! Components I built are on the International Space
Station and I get a ticket for launching a rocket in the park.
Leonard: I don't know if the ticket wwas so much for the launch as for
telling the policewoman "You have to frisk me, I have another rocket in my
pants"!
%
Howard: (To Penny) We need a hot Asian 15-year-old girl.
*Penny slams the door*.
%
Sheldon: My research will go on uninterrupted and social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.
%
Wolowitz: Sheldon, I'd kill my Rabbi with a pork chop to be with your
sister.
%
Sheldon: You're out, too, by the way.
Leonard: Say what?
Sheldon: It's nothing personal, I'd just prefer if my future niece or
nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.
%
Rajesh: Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?
Missy: I guess.
Rajesh: Yes, well, we Indians invented them. (leans in toward her) You're
welcome.
Howard: Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. (leans in toward
Missy) You're welcome.
%
Sheldon: Eat this slice of cheese without farting and you can sleep with
my sister.
%
Howard: Well, she's free to examine my briefs (about Sheldon's sister).
Leonard: Howard!
Howard: I know! I'm disgusting. should be punished. By her. Oh, look I did
it again.
%
Howard: Nobody ever expects me. (Turns to Sheldon's sister and shakes her
hand.) And bam! Howard Wolowitz.
%
Howard: Destiny thy name is Anaheim!
%
Howard: Hey, look at me I'm a fancy Indian man! We invented pajamas!
(About what Raj said to Sheldon's sister.)
%
Sheldon: Why don't you tell them I take tolls at the Golden Gate Bridge? A
Rocket Scientist, how humiliating!
%
Raj: (Strangling Howard) I am Sheeva the Destroyer, I will have the woman.
Howard: I'm warning you, I took Judo at math camp.
%
Raj: (Mocking Howard) Ooh! Look at me, I don't have a foreskin!
%
Raj: (Reading Bulletin) We are testing a new medication for social
anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Why
would they be looking for test subjects here?
Leonard: I don't know, Raj, maybe the comic store doesn't have a bulletin
board.
%
Sheldon: How would one measure a sense of humor? A humormometer?
%
Sheldon: Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.
%
Missy: (Talking to the guys) He was trying to build some sort of armed
robot to keep me out of his room.
Sheldon: Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
%
Howard: You've already got Penny?
Leonard: How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
Howard: So I can have Penny?
Leonard: Hell, no!
%
Sheldon: Why does everyone suddenly wanna talk to me alone? Usually nobody
wants to be alone with me.
%
Sheldon: I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing
mediocre stock.
Missy: And what do you mean "Mediocre stock"?!
Sheldon: That would be you.
%
Raj: She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother, who's
apparently very sick. Oh, and I believe she has to wash her hair.
Howard: Oh, you poor deluded bastard.
Raj: Don't start with me, dude.
Howard: You wanna go again? Let's go.
%
Leonard: On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the
supercollider actually works, it'll create a black hole and swallow up the
Earth, ending life as we know it.
Raj: What a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory, man.
%
Rajesh: I'd rather swim buck naked across the Ganges river with a paper
cut on my nipple than work with you.
%
Sheldon: Yes, since their relationship became carnal, Penny has updated
his designated term of endearment, distinguishing him from those she calls
'sweetie,' usually as an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
Penny: You're boring people, sweetie.
Sheldon: Although sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.
%
Raj: I don't want to go back to India! It's hot, and it's loud, and there
are so many people! You have no idea -- they're everywhere.
%
Raj: I'm going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the
sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay, or as you may know him, Dave from AT&T
customer service.
%
Sheldon: Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies
who disappears halfway through the second reel, I have returned to save
the day. [pause]. Odd, he's usually met by cheers.
%
Sheldon: There's a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately,
you have to be a visionary to see it.
%
Penny: You don't have to thank me every time we have sex, sweetie.
%
Sheldon: *Knock* Raj ... *Knock* ... Raj *Knock* ... Raj.
*Raj answers the door*
Raj: I'm busy.
Sheldon: Doing what? *Raj does his finger trick again* Ok, you've made
your point.
%
Sheldon: I want you to work for me again.
Raj: 'For you' or 'with you'?
Sheldon: In this context, 'for me' can mean 'with me'.
Raj: Okay, but I have some conditions.
Sheldon: I reject them all.
Raj: I'll take the job.
%
Leonard: I*ve always been a little confused about this. Why don*t Hindus
eat beef?
%
Raj: We believe cows are gods.
%
Sheldon: Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
%
Raj: Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I*m in,
I*ll take you out, I swear to cow!
%
Leonard: Pardon me, Sheldon, but how many reels until the protagonist gets
to HIS POINT?
%
Raj: I don't wanna go back to India, it's hot and loud, and there are so
many people! You have no idea, they're everywhere.
%
Howard: What do you mean you didn't get the job? How could you not get it?
Raj: You know, he's British, I'm Indian. Ever since Gandhi, they haven't
liked us very much.
Leonard: Are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because We
should file a complaint.
Raj:That's okay, a complaint's been filed.
%
Raj: You want me to work with you?
Sheldon: For me!
%
Leonard: What have you been doing for the last 6 months.
Raj: You know, checking email, updating my Facebook status, messing up
Wikipedia entries. Did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your
computer now?
%
Sheldon: Alright, we're going to be designing an experiment to look for
the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.
Raj: Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight, ha, ha.
Sheldon stares at Raj.
Raj: I was making a joke.
Sheldon: I'm the boss. I make the jokes.
Raj: Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.
Sheldon: This is not the time for joking.
%
Penny: Amy doesn't want a pocket watch.
Sheldon: Maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
%
Sheldon: This may be hard to believe, but I may not be boyfriend material.
Leonard: Wow. I'm so glad I was sitting down for that!
%
Amy: Jewelry?! Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centered person I
have ever met! Do you really think another transparently manipulative-
ohh, it's a tiara!
%
Wolowizt: I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach
someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
%
Penny: Wow, Amy! You look beautiful!
Amy: Of course, I'm beautiful! I'm a princess! *Hugs Sheldon*
%
Sheldon: (To Penny) You were right, the tiara was too much.
%
Sheldon: I don't think there's anything in this jewelry store that Amy
would appreciate more than the humidifier that we were just looking at at
Sears.
Penny: Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid
stuff.
%
Leonard: Why are you learning Chinese?
Sheldon: I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken
as tangerine chicken, and I intend to confront them.
Leonard: If I were you, I'd be more concerned about what they're passing
off as chicken.
%
*Howard is teaching Sheldon Chinese*.
Howard: You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
Sheldon: Why?
Howard: Once you're fluent, you'll have a billion more people to annoy
instead of me.
%
Raj: Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw up
%
Sheldon: (Chinese) Show Me Your Mucus. Your Mucus!
Chen: (Chinese) Blow Your Own Nose And Go Away!
Sheldon: (Chinese) This is Not a Tangerine Bicycle, Show me your mucus!
%
Chen: Crazy Person, Call the Police.
Sheldon: (Chinese) No, Don't Call the Library, Show Me Your Mucus.
%
Sheldon:(Chinese) Many oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen!
Chen flings his hands at Sheldon!
Sheldon:(Chinese) Oy Vey!
%
Sheldon: (Speaking Chinese to Leonard).
Howard: You just called Leonard a syphillitic donkey.
Sheldon: My apologies, Leonard. I'm only as good as my teacher.
%
Howard: Not now, I have a blog to find. (Referring to a blog based on
Penny and Mike's sex life)
%
Raj: Hey, look, I found an iPod.
Howard: It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it?
Raj: What else? Sell it on eBay as slightly used.
%
Howard: So you're saying, if in the depths of despair she throws herself
at you, and demands you take her right there, right now, you'll just walk
away?
Leonard: I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.
%
Leonard: (Realizing he fixed Penny and Mike's relationship) Maybe I am her
gay friend.
%
Sheldon: Howard, I'm gonna need another mandarin lesson, I obviously
didn't make my point with those people.
Howard: For God's sake, Sheldon, if you don't like the tangerine chicken,
don't order the tangerine chicken.
Sheldon: I like tangerine chicken, I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.
%
Raj: (Reading Game Card) Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll
Leonard: She was mad at him, she was done with him, the relationship was
broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it.
Howard: Boy that story gets better every time you hear it.
%
Penny: (crying) How could he do that?
Leonard: Oh, you did throw an 80-gig iPod-- (Penny looks at Leonard) Yeah,
no, how could he do that?
%
Sheldon: (Practising speaking Mandarin) Show me your citrus peels.
Penny: Sheldon?
*Sheldon freaks out in Chinese.*
Penny: I'm sorry, look, do you have a second?
Sheldon: A second what? Pair of underwear?
%
Penny: Leonard might be home, can we talk in my apartment?
Sheldon: We're not done?
Penny: No!
Sheldon: Eh, why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway.
%
Penny: What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. And
obviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well.
Sheldon: Your last choice worked out for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.
%
Sheldon: (Mandarin) Long live concrete? Thank you.
%
Sheldon: (Eating) Mmm. (In Mandarin) Your monkey sleeps inside me.
%
Leonard: Before you say anything, have you heard of Schrodinger's cat?
Penny: Actually, I've heard far too much about Schrodinger's cat.
Leonard:Good
*Leonard and Penny kiss!*
Penny: Alright, the cat's alive. Let's go to dinner
%
Howard:What's this? (hand movement)
Sheldon:That's what you did, I assumed, as in a number of languages, that
the gesture was part of the phrase.
Howard: Well, it's not.
Sheldon: Why am I supposed to know that? As the teacher, it's your
obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject
matter.
%
Penny: (Throwing iPod out the window) Hey, jerk face, you forgot your
iPod.
%
Penny: (Yelling at Mike) Drop dead, you stupid, self-centered bastard.
%
Howard: Apparently, he (Mike) posted intimate details of their physical
relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere.
%
Leonard: (Reading Mike's blog) Elevators, parks, movie theaters. Out of
curiosity, is this subway, the transportation system, or Subway, the
sandwich shop?
Penny: Sandwich shop.
Leonard: Doesn't that violate the health code or--?
Penny: No, at the sandwich shop, we were only making out.
%
Sheldon: I made tea.
Leonard: I don't want tea.
Sheldon: I didn't make tea for you. This is my tea.
Leonard: Then why are you telling me?
Sheldon: It's a conversation starter.
Leonard: That's a lousy conversation starter.
Sheldon: Oh, is it? We're conversing. Checkmate.
%
Penny Sheldon, did you have a Christmas tree?
Sheldon: Oh, yes... We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable
Santa Clause with plastic reindeer on the front lawn... and to make things
even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they
induced neighborhood-wise seizures.
%
Penny: I always tear up when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.
Sheldon: Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which can lead to
congestive heart failure.
%
Leonard: When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
Sheldon: Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on earth. Frosty
is merely a bit of frozen, supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime,
by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
%
Beverly: So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to
express your latent homosexual feelings towards one another?
%
Beverly: She doesn't have much in the way of career prospects, and don't
make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.
%
Leonard: Merry Newtonmas everyone!
%
Penny: Come on, I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?
Beverly: Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger,
but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by
a loathsome son of a bitch.
Penny: Sure, sure.
%
Raj: You think your thoughts are pure gold, but let me tell you something
they are pure caca.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
Kurt: What?
%
Wolowitz: Check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my
head and cough.
%
Penny: Why can't all guys be like you?
Leonard: Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn't survive.
%
Leonard: That's right! Cuz' that's how we roll in the Shire!
%
Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing
indictment of the American educational system.
Kurt: You're a zebra, right?
Sheldon: (aside, to Leonard) Yet another child left behind ...
%
Wolowitz: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines!
%
Leonard: What's that?
Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset, the cultural convention is to bring
them hot beverages. (a pause as he tries to think of what to do next, then
he says awkwardly) 'There, there'. (another pause) You wanna talk about
it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Good! 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Leonard: If he [Penny's boyfriend, Kurt] were any bigger, he'd have moons
orbiting him.
Sheldon: Oh,SNAP.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler effect.
If I have to, I can demonstrate. NYEEEROOOOM
%
Girl: What are you?
Sheldon: I'm gonna give you a hand: weawww.
Girl: A Choo choo train?
Sheldon: Clouse! weawwww
Girl: A brain damaged choo choo train?
%
Penny: Boy, you're really smart.
Leonard: Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
%
Kurt: You are lucky little dwarf.
Sheldon: He is a hobbit! Don't worry, I've got your back!
%
Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it. I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
%
(Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard are all dressed as the Flash and they
are deciding who will be what.)
Leonard: I call Frodo!
Sheldon, Raj, and Howard: (together) Damn!
%
Raj: (Talking about Howard) Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such
difficulty speaking to women, or around women, or at times even effeminate
men.
%
Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Sheldon: Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.
Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
%
Raj: Okay, if no one else will say it, I will. We really suck at
paintball.
%
Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah
party.
%
Sheldon: We were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of
some people to follow the chain of command.
Leonard: Sheldon, let it o.
Sheldon: No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the
back.
Howard: I shot you for a good reason. You were leading us into disaster.
Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.
Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling, "Get the kid in the yarmulke! Get
the kid in the yarmulke!"
%
Penny: So, how was paint ball? Did you have fun?
Sheldon: If you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard)
You clear a space on your calendar. There will be an inquiry.
%
Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.
Raj: Or we could walk right behind each other all night. It'll look like
one person going really fast.
Howard: No, no, no. It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
%
Leonard: What's this?
Sheldon: Tea. it's costumary to serve hot beverages when one is in
emotional distress. [pats Leonard's head] There there. You want to talk
about it?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Thank godness. 'There there' was really all I had.
%
Sheldon: I don't care if nobody gets it! I'm going as the doppler effect!
%
Leonard: (To Sheldon) You're talking like a crazy person.
Mary: Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he's fine.
Sheldon: (To Leonard) Told ya.
%
Sheldon: You can lead a chicken to crisco, but you can't make your mother
fry it.
%
Raj: I couldn't find you guys, so I bought six new friends! Sadly, three
of them are dead.
%
(To Mary, about Sheldon & Amy's relationship)
Leonard: It's kinda like the Loch Ness Monster. Maybe there's something
there, maybe there isn't. We'll never know but sometimes it's fun to creep
yourself out thinking about it.
%
Sheldon: That reminds me of another saying: You can lead a chicken to
Crisco, but you can't make your mother fry it.
Mary Cooper: Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken and I will
put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.
Leonard: Please pester her? Please? For me.
%
Mary: Back home, there's a woman works at the Wal-Mart - tall, tall girl.
Woman could hunt geese with a rake.
%
(Talking about about his mother's upcoming Christian cruise)
Sheldon: Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see how advanced your group has
become -- willing to sail into the ocean without fear of falling off the
edge.
%
(Howard has just told Mary about his upcoming trip to the International
Space Station.)
Mary Cooper: I bet your mom is really proud of you.
Howard: Nope. She says if I don't back out, she's gonna go on a hunger
strike. It'd take years before she'd be in any kind of danger, but
still....
%
Mary: (To Leonard, explaining Gunning with God) Oh, it is a hoot and a
half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire 'em up in the air
and you pulverize 'em with a twelve gage shotgun full of our Lord's
forgiveness.
%
Leonard: What did you think of the sushi?
Mary: It was good. Only thing - would have made it better if it was cooked
- and if it was beef!
%
Mary: Just because a cat's got kittens in the oven doesn't make 'em
biscuits.
%
Mary: Could the reason you can't find a guy is because you're letting them
ride the rollercoaster without buying a ticket?
Penny: Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes
they only get to spin the teacups.
%
Mary Cooper: It's all themed. There's Jonah and the Whale Watching.
All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet. And my personal favorite, Gunning with
God.
%
Penny: That top has paid off in free drinks 10 times what I originally
paid for it.
Sheldon: Yes, Penny has a lot of money tied up in promiscuity futures.
%
Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood -- or, to use the
clinical term, bitchiness -- is because your mother isn't making you a
priority?
Sheldon: No. Or, to use the clinical term: "nuh-uh."
%
Sheldon: There's a lot of harm in trying something new. That's why we test
out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
%
Mary Cooper: When I was your age you could have me for a car ride and a
bottle of strawberry wine.
%
Sheldon: I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman,
Weisskopf ...
Mary: Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats, and you gave 'em cute Jewish
names.
%
Howard: On the potty, what are you five?
Raj: It's a potty, what do you call it?
Howard: A toilet.
Raj: That's a little vulgar for the dinner table, don't you think?
Howard: and potty is okay?
Raj: Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
Howard: What do you do on the potty, wee-wee?
Raj: If I don't have to boom-boom.
%
Sheldon: I know mother, but you're not fooling me. Every time you want to
talk it means you want me listen.
Mrs. Cooper: Then stop talking.
Sheldon: Yes, M'am
%
Howard: Women, you can't live with them. You can't successfully refute
thier hypotheses.
Sheldon: Amen to that.
%
Sheldon: She was girl who was my friend, and not she is a girl who is not
my friend.
Penny: That has to be the worst country music song ever.
%
*Howard imitates Raj's drunken Bollywood Breakdance*
Raj: Dude! That's offensive!
Howard: Yah! We all thought so!
%
Penny: How's your life?
Amy: Like everybody else's - subject to entropy, decay and eventual death.
Thank you for asking.
%
Penny: Oh Balls!
%
Sheldon: Leonard, be serious. We're playing a game here.
%
Sheldon: He's just so zazzy, don't you think?
%
Sheldon: And Zazzles. He's so... Zazzy.
%
Amy: Is he (Leonard) always like this when he loses?
Sheldon: Oh, yes. You should have been here for the great Jenga tantrum of
Leonard: You bumped the table and you know it.
%
Sheldon: I named him Zazzles because he's so zazzy!
%
Leonard: We need to widen our circle.
Sheldon: I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
Leonard: Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
Sheldon: That’s the beauty of it.
%
Penny: I’m a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need
to know.
Sheldon: Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural
delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Penny: (puzzled) Participate in the what?
%
Sheldon: What if she ends up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should
use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
Leonard: I'm sure she'll still love him.
Sheldon: I wouldn't.
%
Penny: (after seeing Leonard and Sheldon pantsed) I'm so sorry. I really
thought if you guys went instead of me, he wouldn't be such an ass.
Leonard: No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Sheldon: "Was a valid hypo" - what is happening to you?
%
Leonard: Our children will be smart and beautiful!
Sheldon: Not to mention imaginary.
%
Penny: So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
%
Leonard: I love cheesecake.
Sheldon: You're lactose-intolerant.
Leonard: I don't eat it. I just think it's a good idea.
%
Sheldon: I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as
far as the population of this car goes you're a veritable mack daddy.
%
Penny: Would it be weird if I used your shower?
Leonard: No.
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: (to Sheldon) No!
Sheldon: No?
Leonard: No!
Sheldon: (to Penny) No.
%
Leonard: Come on! We have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure
out how to get into a stupid building.
*Two girls selling cookies ring every bell, the door opens*
Sheldon: What do you think their combined IQ is ?
%
Leonard: New neighbor?
Sheldon: It seems so.
Leonard: Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Sheldon: A 200 pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes, she is.
%
Leonard: What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male
and she's a female.
%
Sheldon: Yes, but not of the same species.
%
Penny: Oh, anyways I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this
sensitive girl who comes to LA from Lincoln, Nebraska, to be an actress
and who ends up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.
Leonard: So it's based on your life?
Penny: No, I'm from Omaha!
%
Sheldon: My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard: I'm Sorry!
Sheldon: You're gonna have to call her.
%
Sheldon: So, if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it
and either is observed, it will not go through both. If it's unobserved,
it will. However, if it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits
it's target, it will not have gone through both slits.
Leonard: Agreed! What's Your Point?
Sheldon: There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt!
%
Leonard: (Helping Althea with the crossword puzzle) One across is Aegean,
eight down is Nabokov, 26 across is MCM, fourteen down is-- move your
finger, phylum, which makes 14 across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's
capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
Leonard: What are you, kidding? You're a semi-pro.
Sheldon: No, we are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that
our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring. Think about that. I have
a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
%
Sheldon: Do you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard: Not really!
Sheldon: If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters,
most people will trip.
Leonard: I don't care. 2 millime--? That's doesn't seem right.
Sheldon: It's true. I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father
broke his clavicle.
Leonard: Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon: No. That was the result of my work with lasers.
%
Leonard: I'm gonna invite her (Penny) over. We'll have a nice meal and
chat.
%
Sheldon: Chat? But we don't chat, at least not off-line.
%
Sheldon: Penny!
Penny: Yeah?
Sheldon: That's where I sit.
Penny: So sit next to me.
Sheldon: No, I sit there.
%
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE
STEAK!!!
Sheldon: Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
%
Penny: (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like
as long as high school.
Sheldon: It took you 4 years to get through high school?
%
Sheldon: It has been some time since we had a woman take her clothes off
in our apartment.
Leonard: That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving, my Grandmother with
Alzheimer's had that episode?
Sheldon: Point taken, it has been some time since we had a woman take her
clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
Leonard: The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
%
Howard: Wait till you see this.
Raj: It's fantastic. Unbelievable!
Leonard: See what?
Howard: (Putting in DVD) It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard: This isn't a good time.
Howard: (Imitating Stephen Hawking) It's before he became a creepy
computer voice.
%
Leonard: Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
Althea: If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
%
Leonard: I have a board, if you like boards. This is my board.
Penny: Holy smokes.
Sheldon: If by "holy smokes", you mean a derivative restatement of the
kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT,
sure.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit
brokenhearted"?
%
Kurt: How the hell did you get in the building?
Leonard: We're scientists!
Sheldon: Tell him about our IQ!
%
Penny: Get your noise-cancelling headphones, 'cause it's gonna get loud.
Sheldon: Oh, not this again!
%
Sheldon: Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I'm sorry to inform you that you've
been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey upon the
gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I am being blackmailed with a
hidden dirty sock.
Amy: If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share
your aversion to soiled hosiery.
%
Sheldon: That's not afternoon. That's prevening.
%
Sheldon: Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring
to oneself as one.
%
Wolowitz: Good God, what have we done?
%
Sheldon: As a native Texan, I must say I've never heard the phrase
'yeeehaw' used in quite that context.
%
Penny: Damn you, you rat bastard! In the olden days, I never would have
known he was that stupid!
%
Sheldon: With skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
Howard: That's a bazinga, right?
Sheldon: One of my best, don't you think?
%
Raj: The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.
%
Leonard: Relax, it's just a dirty sock.
Sheldon: How on earth can you say "dirty sock" and "relax" in the same
sentence?
%
Zack: Is that the laser? It's bitchin'.
Sheldon: Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic
foundation for the laser in his paper "Zur Quantentheorie de Strahlung",
his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'.
%
Leonard: She didn*t dump me. We were just in different places in the
relationship.
Sheldon: I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a
geographical location.
Wolowitz: It*s very simple, Leonard was living in a little town called
*Please don*t leave me*, while Penny had just moved to the island of
*Bye-bye*!
%
Howard: *Noticing Raj peeking through someone's window using the
telescope* Oh, Raj, no.
Wolowitz: Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and
filling it with pictures of naked women,so we don't have to peep through
windows.
%
Leonard: *Explaining the significance of the experiment to Zack* Think
about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way
of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put
there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented
the airplane.
Zack: *Astonishingly* What species is that?
%
(everyone puts on protection goggles)
Zack:Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D!
%
Zack: How can you bounce a laser off the moon if there's no gravity?
%
Amy: You should also know, that all physical contact up to and including
coitus is off the table. *Pause*
Sheldon: May I buy you a beverage?
Amy: Tepid water please. *Pause*
Wolowitz: My God, what have we done?
%
Leonard: I'm going to pick you up at 8. I'm going to show you a night that
you will never forget. (Talking about how he is going to show more
confidence towards women.)
Raj: (Excitedly) Where are we going?
%
Penny: Sheldon, you can't re-program people.
Sheldon: No, you can't re-program people!
%
Wolowitz: But you love that spot.
Sheldon: No, I love my mother, my feelings for my spot are much greater.
%
Penny: How long was it?
Leonard: 94 seconds!
%
Leonard: Hi. I'm Leonard. You are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz
e-lec-tric. I'm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will
nev-er for-get.
%
Sheldon: If ifs and buts were candies and nuts, we would all have a merry
Christmas.
%
Penny: Why don't you go to the Green Olive?
Sheldon: I don't like the Green Olive. They treat me like family.
%
Sheldon: And here is my Justice League membership card, but that doesn't
prove I know Batman.
%
Sheldon: I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail.
Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there's an app for that.
%
Raj: I haven't cried this hard since Toy Story 3!
%
Penny (as barkeeper): OK Sheldon, what can I get ya?
Sheldon: Alcohol.
Penny: Could you be a little more specific?
Sheldon: Ethyl alcohol ... 40 milliliters.
%
Sheldon: It doesn't matter. They'll find a way to give me a one-way ticket
back to Ghandiville. And by the way, when I say that, it'%u2019s not
offensive.
%
Sheldon: There's always a chance that alcohol and poor judgment on her
part may lead to a wonderful evening.
%
Sheldon: I think that you [Leonard] have as much of a chance of having a
sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering
at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
%
Wolowitz: So, how’d it go with Leslie?
Leonard: Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move… I mean any more
than the 383 miles it was gonna move anyway!
%
Sheldon: You have about as much chance with her as the Hubble Telescope
does of finding in the middle of each black hole a small man looking for
the light switch.
%
Sheldon: I don't come over to your house changing things on your boards.
Leslie: That's because I don't have mistakes on my boards.
Sheldon: That's...That's...
Leslie: When you think up an adjective text me.
%
Sheldon: (to Leonard, who has decided to give up on Penny) Well, at least
now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so you don't
crash into Geek Mountain again.
%
Wolowitz: Love is not a sprint, it's a marathon, a relentless pursuit that
only ends when she falls into your arms - or hits you with the pepper
spray.
%
Leonard: Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
%
Wolowitz: I am the sword master!
%
Sheldon: Score 1 for liquor and poor judgement.
%
Sheldon: I do feel obligated to point out to you.... that she did not
reject you, you did not ask her out
Leonard: You're right. I didn't ask her out. I should ask her out.
Sheldon: No! No that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.
Leonard: No, but you're right, I should march over there and ask her out.
Sheldon: Oh goody! We're getting a cat.
%
Raj: (Play World of Warcraft) Blowing the gates. Control, shift B.
%
Raj: Tonight, I spice my mead with goblin blood.
%
Raj: He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on eBay.
Leonard: You betrayed us for money? Who are you?
Sheldon: I'm a rogue knight elf. Don't you people read character
descriptions?
%
Sheldon: Whoo! I'm all sweaty. Anybody wanna log on to Second Life and go
swimming? I just built a virtual pool.
Leonard: No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
%
Doug: What's up, bro?
Leonard: Uh, nothing much... Bro!
%
Sheldon: Penny for your thoughts?
%
Leonard: I was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a
neurochemical overlay.
Leslie: Wait, are you asking me out?
%
Howard: Sheldon, if you were a robot and I knew and you didn't, would you
want me to tell you?
Sheldon: That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to
handle it?
Howard: Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your
side.
%
Sheldon: Is that sex starting now?
Leonard: I'm having a panic attack.
Sheldon: Oh, Okay, well then ... Calm down!
%
Sheldon: Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don't you think that
if I were wrong, I'd know it?
%
Wolowitz: Sex is never the way I dreamed it was going to be.
Raj: Because in your dreams, you're a horse from the waist down.
%
Leonard: Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
Penny: Because I like peppermint, and it's fun to say schnapps!
%
Raj: I don't like bugs, okay? They freak me out.
Sheldon: Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must
render you catatonic.
%
Sheldon: *Holding Flash #123* I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-conceived
cricket wager.
Penny: What, do they have Wii Cricket now? Well, that can’t be very
popular.
%
Rajesh: Ooo, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
%
Sheldon: I am not crazy, my mother had me tested.
%
Sheldon: Excuse me! Wolverine Origin, mini series issue two, page 22,
retractable bone claws. You know, if you three spent less time thinking
about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we would have much
less of these embarrassing moments.
%
Leonard: Ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells
and stimulates re-uptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like
gamma-amino butyric acid.
%
Sheldon: Could we focus on what's important here? I lost a bet to
Wolowitz!
%
Wolowitz:I think that you and Penny had a poor night!
Leonard: It wasn't poor! It was... just fine!
Raj: Dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine!
%
Penny: Hey Sheldon, whattcha got there a new comic book?
Sheldon: Old comic book. I just got it from the safe deposit box.
Penny: What do you have a safe deposit box for?
Sheldon: Old comic books.
%
Leonard: I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three
better friends!
%
Howard: What's the matter, you chicken?
Sheldon: I've always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not by
nature at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbor's chicken got
loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
Raj: Chickens can't climb trees.
Sheldon: Thank God!
Howard: Okay, I believe the chicken made you his bitch.
%
Sheldon: Another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
Howard: Shiksa. Shiksa.
Sheldon: Forgive me, Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas, and if it was,
it wasn't spoken for long.
%
Crawley: Ha-ha. Don't knock, just walk in. Why be polite to the world's
leading expert on the dung beetle?
%
Crawley: I've been studying insects since I was 8 years old. You know what
they use to call me in school? Creepy Crawley!
%
Howard: Could you look at Toby?
Crawley: Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.
Sheldon: (To Howard) Told you.
%
Sheldon: Professor, can you identify our cricket?
Crawley: Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the
planet. Not that that's gonna keep me from having to move in with my
daughter in Oxnard, and we're not talking Oxnard at the beach, No! We're
talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
%
Penny: Where are you going?
Sheldon: Wherever the music takes me, kitten.
%
Howard: Sometime thru the night an armadillo fell in, then he spooned me.
%
Leonard: Please don't be Sheldon playing Bongos.
.....
Leonard: Please don't be Sheldon playing Bongos.
%
Wolowitz: I'm so dehydrated. My pee's like toothpaste.
%
Sheldon: Walkin' down the stairs while playing bongos.
*Sheldon falls*
Sheldon: Never walk down the stairs while playing bongos.
%
Sheldon: Bongo solo!
%
Amy: There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.
%
Amy: The only person who signed my yearbook was my mother. "Dear Amy, self
respect and a hymen are far better than friends and fun, Love Mom".
%
Bernadette: Good Morning, handsome.
Howard: (Waking up) Good morning, mom.
Bernadette: It's me!
%
Sheldon: *Karate chops Leonard* She is not for you!
%
Amy: I have a sorta kinda boyfriend at home playing with a model train,
but you don't hear me bitching about it.
%
Bernadette: (Sounding like Mrs. Wolowitz) He wants some butter!
%
Penny: Hey Sheldon, let's play punchies to see who gets the last dumpling
%
Leonard: It turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and
have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin is a little worse for
wear.
*Sheldon karate chops Leonard*
Leonard: Why did you do that?
Sheldon: To send a message: She is not for you!
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Not for you!
%
Wolowitz: You have to wonder about grown men who play with toy trains.
%
Sheldon: All these years I've been so wrong! The tinier the trains, the
more concentrated the fun!
%
Raj: Oh Leonard, you remind of the funny old story of the man who walks
into a Women's Correctional Facility with a stack of paperwork that would
allow the female convicts to go free.
Leonard: You're saying I couldn't get laid in woman's prison with a
handful of pardons.
Raj: Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
%
Leonard: What would you be if you were attached to another object by an
inclined plane, wrapped helically around an axis?
Sheldon: Screwed.
Leonard: There you go.
%
Sheldon: She is a girl, who is a friend, but she is not, forgive me for
doing this, (makes air quotes) my "girlfriend".
%
Sheldon: You know it just occured to me, if there are an infinite number
of parallel universes, in one of them there's probably a Sheldon who
doesn't believe parallel universes exist.
Leonard: Probably. What's your point?
Sheldon: No point. It's just one of those things that makes one of the
me's chuckle. *Laughs*
%
Raj: Ok, two words. Deaf chick. It doesn't matter if I can't talk because
she can't hear me.
Leonard: What?
Raj: That's what she said.
%
(Sheldon yelling Leonard's name all the way down the stairs until he finds
him)
Leonard: Yeah, what?
Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
Leonard: Yeah, so.
Sheldon: What does that mean?
Leonard: Well, you know how you're always saying Amy is a girl who is your
friend but not your girlfriend.
Sheldon: Uh huh.
Leonard: Well, you can't say that anymore.
%
Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing anyone has
ever said to me!
%
Leonard: Have you considered telling her how you feel?
Sheldon: Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie!
%
Amy's Mom: It's nice to meet you too Sheldon, I honestly didn't believe
Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.
Sheldon: I assure you, I am quite real and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.
Amy's Mom: What?
Sheldon: Oh yes, We're like wild animals in heat. It's a wonder neither of
us has been hurt!
Amy's Mum: Amy? What is he saying?
Amy: You wanted me to have a boyfriend, mother, well here he is! Have to
sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loin.
Sheldon: Oh yes. It's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina.
%
Sheldon: We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles, we live at 311 Los Robles.
*Holds up number 2 fixture*
Leonard: You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
Sheldon: No worries, I explained our predicament to our letter carrier. He
was sympathetic, his exact words were "Got your back Jack. Bitches be
crazy!"
%
*Sheldon spots Amy Farrah Fowler outside the apartment*
Sheldon: Oh dear... they really do be crazy.
%
Leonard: All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying
to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably make an actual Hulk.
%
Sheldon: Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in
coitus at least one time in our relationship ... bazinga!
%
Amy: I find the notion of romantic love an unnecessary cultural construct
that adds no value to human relationships.
%
Sheldon: Proxima Centauri's the nearest star. The celestial bodies that
follow are:
Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, Laland 21185, Sirius A,
Sirius B, BL Ceti, UV Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani,﻿ Lac
9352, Ross 128, EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B,﻿ EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A.
Those are the stars that are nearest to me,
Tra la la and fiddle dee dee!
%
Leonard: What about you, Stuart? Do you have a girlfriend yet?
Stuart: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I met her at Comic-con. The one place in the world
where saying, "I own a comic book store", is an actual pick-up line.
Leonard: Oh, well, good for you.
Stuart: Not really, she's horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts
on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts, "Who wants to take a
ride in my invisible plane?"
Leonard:Why don't you just break up with her.
Stuart: Heh, no, I can't.
Leonard: Why not?
Stuart: Because then I'd be alone. Like you.

Sheldon: Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in
coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga!
%
Rajesh: Ah beer, the magic elixir that can turn this poor shy Indian boy
in the life of the party ... Oh yeah!
%
Wil Wheaton: You ready to bowl?
Sheldon: Oh, I'm ready! I don't know if Stewart told you what you are up
against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas
Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League Championship team ... seven to
twelve year old division ... also Penny is pretty good.
Wheaton: Great! then it's ON
Sheldon (to himself): Foolish Will Wheaton, it was never off!
%
*After getting a spare in the bowling match*
Sheldon: THANK YOU JESUS!!! ... as my mother would say.
%
Sheldon: I am the ball, my thoughts are its thoughts, its holes are my
holes.
%
Wil Wheaton: Embrace the dark side!
Sheldon: That's not even from your franchise!
%
Sheldon: Well, well, well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton. The Green Goblin to my
Spider-Man, the Pope Paul V to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my
Firefox!
%
Sheldon: I am the proud owner of WilWheatonStinks.com, .net and .org!
%
Penny: 'Do or do not do there is only try.'
Leonard: My girlfriend quoted Star Wars!
Penny: I believe I quoted The Empire Strikes Back.
%
(After Penny leaves the bowling alley for the second time)
Sheldon: You did this, didn't you?
Wil Wheaton: Come on, Sheldon, do you really think I'd break up a couple
just to win a bowling game?
Sheldon: ...no, I suppose not.
Wheaton: Good. Keep thinking that. (walks away)
Sheldon: (realizing he's been had yet again) Wheeeeatoooon!
%
Wolowitz: Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?
Rajesh: Big or small, I don't like rabbits. They always look like they're
about to say something, but they never do.
%
Raj: I don't like rabbits. They always look like they're about to say
something, but they never do.
%
Wolowitz: Yeah, nothing more fearsome than a man with music blasting from
between his nipples.
%
Sheldon: It's hard to say no to Yoohoo - it literally beckons.
%
Sheldon: According to the Roommate Agreement, Paragraph 9, Subsection B:
The right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure,
and believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force!
%
Leonard: She finished top of her class Cambridge University and is
licensed to practice law in three countries ... and your face!
%
Sheldon: The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb.
%
Sheldon: Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of
scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?
%
Amy: You're like a sexy toddler.
%
Sheldon: And what a civilisation is the Greeks. They gave us science,
democracy and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.
%
Sheldon: (To Priya) You may have gone to Cambridge but I'm an honorary
graduate of Starfleet Academy!
%
Sheldon: (To Amy) Ah, memory impairment; the free prize at the bottom of
every vodka bottle!
%
Sheldon: Leonard, are you in the shower?
Leonard: I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.
Sheldon: I asked if you were in the shower, but that's moot now.
Leonard: What?
Sheldon: Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
Leonard: I can't hear you, I'm in the shower.
Sheldon: (Entering bathroom) I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency!
Leonard: What kind of an emergency?
Sheldon: Mathematical. 32 ounce banana smoothie, 16 ounce bladder.
%
Amy: Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of
business. (Kisses him)
Sheldon: Fascinating.
Amy: I hope you don't take what I'm about to do as a comment on what we
just did. (Runs to bathroom and vomits)
%
Sheldon: (To the smoking monkey) You really are an ass.
%
Sheldon: The mean Indian lady made me eat lamb.
%
Penny: Sheldon, you know, I do understand what you're going through.
Sheldon: Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in Waitressing stolen
from you?
%
Howard: Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for
magnetic monopoles and not finding anything, and you were acting like an
obnoxious, giant dictator?
Raj: I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
Howard: That's why I added the '-tator'.
%
Sheldon: Hello Penny. I realize you are currently in the mercy if your
primitive biological urges. But, as you have an entire lifetime of poor
decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?
%
Sheldon: They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know
that's why they hated me.
%
Sheldon (to his mom): But, evolution is not opinion, it's a fact!
Sheldon's mom: And that is your opinion!
Sheldon (to Leonard, Howard and Raj): I forgive you, let's go home.
%
Raj: I like the new look
Howard: Thanks.....I call it the Clooney
Raj: I call it the Mario and Luigi but whatever
%
Leonard: Would please take off that stupid hat?
Howard: No, I want to blend in.
Raj: To what? Toy Story.
%
Sheldon: I don't know which artic expedition you guys were on, but I
thought it was a hoot and a half.
%
Howard: Damn it! I should've gone over and told [Penny] we were back.
Raj: Yeah, it was first come first serve.
%
Sheldon: No mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my
safety. The fact that I am home safe does not prove it worked, that logic
is post hoc ergo propter hoc. No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
%
Wolowitz: You remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic
monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious
giant dictator?
Koothrappali: I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
Wolowitz: That's why I added the "-tator".
%
Wolowitz: I would like a slippery nipple.
%
Howard: (Southern Accent) If y'all don't mind, I got a hankering for a
lone star beer.
Mary: There's no alcohol in this household, stop talking like that, and
lose the hat.
Howard: Sorry, I'll take a diet yoo-hoo if you have one.
Mary: You'll take a Coke.
%
Howard: I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
Raj: It's like a snowy nightmare from which there's no awakening.
%
Sheldon: If this is about the night the heat went out, there's nothing to
be embarassed about.
Raj: It's not about that.
Howard: We agreed to never speak of it again.
Sheldon: So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body
temperatures from plummeting.
Howard: He's speaking about it.
Raj: For me, it was a bonding moment.
%
Leonard: (To Penny, about Sheldon) When he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill
him. There was even a plan, we were going to throw his Kindle outside, and
when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
Sheldon: (Shocked) That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
Leonard: No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four
different sled-dog team and yell "Mush"!
%
Penny: When I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was
gonna be named head cheerleader, I was so excited. My mom even made me a
celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head
cheerleader, big old slutbag.
Sheldon: Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely
comparible to a Nobel Prize?
Penny: Well, they're pretty tasty.
Sheldon: And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your
current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you ever truly believe that you
were fit to be a cheer leader?
%
Sheldon: Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.
%
Sheldon: (To his spot) Hello, old friend, (sitting down) Daddy's home.
%
Sheldon:I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won't
forget your contributions.
Howard: Great!
Sheldon: Of course, I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech.
But, when I get around to writing my memoirs, you can expect a very
effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy.
%
Sheldon: You fellas are planning a party for me, aren't you?
Howard: Okay, Sheldon, sit down.
Sheldon: If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know that I
don't care for luau, toga, or under the sea.
%
Sheldon: What are they doing here?
Leonard: We came to apologize again and bring you home. So why don't you
pack up your stuff, and we'll head back?
Sheldon: No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over, and I
will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to
creationists.
Mrs. Cooper: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone's entitled to their
opinion.
%
Sheldon: What are you talking about?
Leonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after 3 dates.
Sheldon: I see. Now, are we talking date the social interaction or date
the dried fruit?
%
Sheldon: Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking
out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.  Wolowitz:
Thank you, Sheldon.  Sheldon: And whether that propigation is in the
interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
%
Sheldon: (On helium) Kripke! I found the nozzle. I'm gonna kill you!
%
*In the bathtub*.
Howard: So nice you could join me this evening, you're looking lovely as
always.
Katee Sackhoff: Thanks Howard, always nice to be part of your masturbatory
fantasies.
%
Raj: We are from the Lollipop guild and we want you!
%
[Video of Sheldon playing after his prank on Kripke, which also hit the
university president and board of directors]
%
Sheldon: Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the
malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you would like to see the look on
your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh,
and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support
and encouragement in this enterprise.
%
Sheldon: WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEATON!
%
Sheldon: What do you want?
Raj: *High voice* We represent the Lollipop Guild and we want you!
%
Leonard (to Sheldon): What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than
he made you look?
Raj: I don't think that's possible, dude.
Leonard (to Raj): You're not helping.
Raj: I didn't come here to help, I came here to mock.
%
Sheldon: Thank you Kripke for depriving me of the oppotunity to share my
news with my friends!
Kripke: My pleasure!
Sheldon: My thank you was not sincere.
Kripke: Hm, but my pleasure is!
%
Sheldon: ... and here's Uranus!
%
Penny: Why are you back from your date so early?
Howard: Well, in romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting
more.
Penny: (To Leonard) What exactly does that mean.
Leonard: He struck out!
%
Sheldon: (In a high-pitched voice due to helium) Kripke, I found the
nozzle, I'm gonna kill you!
%
Sheldon: Are we talking "date", the social interaction or "date" the dried
fruit?
%
Raj: I was on the radio, once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Dehli and
was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays: Fever 104 (speaking
Hindi).
*The guys stare at Raj*
Raj: That means "Fever 104: Home of the really good current music."
*The guys stare at him more.*
Raj: It's much catchier in Hindi.
%
Leonard: You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don't have to do
it.
Raj: In fact, it's better if you don't. Otherwise, it makes the rest of us
look bad.
%
Penny: Yo, Raj, talk to me. (Raj says nothing) I'm sorry, just screwing
with you.
%
Ira Flatow: (Over the radio) Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.
Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.
Ira Flatow: Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to
our audience just what a monopole is?
Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet, which has, as even
the most uneducated (voice becoming high-pitched) in your audience must
know, two poles (clears throat) a north and south pole. If you cut that in
half, you have 2 smaller magnets each with it's own north and south pole.
Ira Flatow: Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our
connection.
Sheldon: No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has 2
poles. The primary characteristics of a monopoles is that it has only one
pole, hence, "monopole".
%
Mrs. Wolowitz: Howard! What are you doing in there?
Howard: I'm taking a bath.
Mrs. Wolowitz: I hope that's all you're doing, we share that tub.
Howard: DON'T REMIND ME!
%
Sheldon: I refuse to sink to his level.
Raj: You can't sink, with all that helium in you, you're lucky you don't
flow away.
%
Raj: (Looking at laptop) Here comes Kripke.
Leonard: Who's that with him?
Raj: I believe that's the president of the university.
Leonard: And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
Sheldon: There is no abort.
Raj: How could you not put in an abort?
Sheldon: I made a boo-boo, all right?
%
Howard: (Singing) Bernadette, I am so sorry for... trying to propose to
you! Bernadette, you found it creepy, but... that's just the kind of thing
I do...Aaaaaaaaahhh! I know now it's too soon to talk of love, it was just
a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. Bernadette, give me one more
chance, Sweet Bernadette! I'll get the hang of this thing they call
romance, Sweet Bernadette! I dream to once again kiss your lips, Sweet
Bernadette! Sincerely Yours, Howard Wolowitz! Bernadette! (Song Ends)
Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!
%
*Wolowitz checks his Caller ID*.
Wolowitz: Ooh, looks like I'm gonna have sex tonight. (answers) Hey,
baby...
Penny: His right hand is calling him?
%
*Discussing Paintball Strategy*
Raj: We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
Leonard: I forget, which one is Hammer of the Gods?
Raj: We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people
when they come to pee.
%
*Wolowitz and Leslie in bed post-coitus*
Leslie: Boy, your heart's racing. I must've really gotten you going.
Wolowitz: Well, it's partly you, partly my transient idiopathic
arrhythmia.
Leslie: Sexy.
%
Penny: Ok, ok, how about this. We tell him somebody broke in?
Leonard: Just to shoot the couch with the paint ball gun?
Penny: I'm sorry, I'll buy it. All those people are on drugs.
Leonard: We can tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their
boyfriend.
%
Sheldon: Excuse me, but the problem is NOT solved. If your HEAD had been
accidentally amputated and we transplanted a dog's head in its place,
would that be problem solved?
Leonard: If it were your head it would be.
%
Penny: What are we gonna do?
Leonard: We? No, no, no. You had your chance to be "we" for like a year
and a half now. Right now, you are you and you are screwed!
%
Penny: Look, Sheldon, I'm really, really sorry but it's only going to be
for a week. Can't you be a little bit flexible?
[Leonard, Howard, Raj and Sheldon all look at her]
Penny: Yeah, sorry, I didn't really think that through.
%
Sheldon: There's an economic concept known as a positional good in which
an object is only valued by the possessor because it's not possessed by
others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace
the more colloquial, but less precise "neener-neener".
%
Penny: I think I caught the flu. *Throwing up*. Or the plague!
%
Leonard: What would you do if you were me?
Wolowitz: I would take Sheldon to Switzerland!
Leonard: Really?
Wolowitz: Yes, and I'd leave him there!
%
Raj: If anyone's interested, I'll be spending this Valentine's in the same
way I spend every Valentine's. Buying disoriented chicken from the
supermarket, taking home, standing over the sink and eating out of the
packet with my bear hands like an animal.
%
Sheldon: Given that Saint Valentine was a 3rd century Roman priest, who
was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the
evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
%
Sheldon: (Realizing Penny got him sick) It was you ... I touched you!
Penny: Happy Valentines Day!
%
Sheldon: You know, it's amazing how many super villains have advanced
degrees.
Penny sighs and rolls her eyes.
Sheldon: Graduate schools should do a better job of screening those people
out.
%
Sheldon: Oh Mario ... if only I could control everyone the way I control
you ... HOP! YOU LITTLE PLUMBER! HOP! HOP! HOP!
%
Sheldon: Bring out the Red Bull, it%u2019s time to rock Mario old school!
%
(Sheldon snorts)
Leonard: Sheldon. Don't make that noise, it's disrespectful.
Sheldon: I should hope so. It was a snort of derision.
%
Penny: Well why don't you go to the movies then?
Sheldon: Because who would be there to perform the Heimlich maneuver if I
choke on my popcorn?
Penny: So, don't buy popcorn.
Sheldon: No popcorn at the mo - listen to yourself!
%
Sheldon: Worst Renaissance Fair ever!
Leonard: Please let it go, Sheldon.
Sheldon: It was rife with historical inaccuracies, for example, the tavern
girl, serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but
in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws, or Reinheitgebot, severely limited the
availability of mead. At best, they would've had some spiced wine.
Leonard: You're nitpicking!
Sheldon: Oh, really? Well, here's another nit for you, the flagons would
not have been made of polypropylene.
%
Howard: Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy, they're about
taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so
tight their bosom jumps out and says, "Howdy".
Sheldon: Bosoms would not have said "Howdy" in the 15th century. If
anything, they would've said "Huzzah".
Howard: I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part
of the conversation.
%
Penny: Looks like you've been to the Renaissance Fair ... I'm hoping.
Sheldon: Renaissance Fair? More of a medieval-slash-Age of
Enlightment-slash-any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.
%
Raj: What happens in costume at comic-con stays at comic-com.
Howard: You're only saying that because of what happened to you.
Leonard: What happened to you?
Raj: Nothing happened to me.
Howard: It wasn't your fault, Raj, he was dressed like a green Orion slave
girl.
Raj: How did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on,
dude, you have totally not moved on.
%
Howard: Go get yourself some rebound stress release.
Raj: Technically, it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually
engaged in physical intimacy.
Howard: You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
Raj: I bought him dinner and we kissed once. That was it. And he told me
his name was Kimberly.
%
Sheldon: Look on the bright side.
Leonard: What's the bright side?
Sheldon: Only 9 more months to Comic-Con.
%
Raj: You heard me, I forbidded it.
Priya: Forbidded it?
Raj: Forbid..ed.. it?
%
Amy: Thanks to you (Penny), I just made a rhesus monkey cry like a
disgraced TV evangelist.
%
Mrs. Wolowitz: Who's there? Are you a sex criminal?
Howard: Sex Criminals don't have KEYS MA!!!
Mrs. Wolowitz: Where were you so late?
Howard: I was out with Bernadette
Mrs. Wolowitz: I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God,
you used a condom.
Howard: I am not having this conversation with you ma.
Mrs. Wolowitz: God forbid you get one of them fancy sex diseases.
Howard: Nobody has a disease!!
Mrs. Wolowitz:I hope not, I share a toilet with you. Is that what you
want, to give your mother herpes?
%
Sheldon: Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may
stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I might quote
Howard, "Do the dance with no pants".
%
Sheldon: The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in
the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like
an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
%
Sheldon: (To Howard) Just keep in mind should you ever need a slightly
apathetic, tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.
%
Sheldon: While you're at it I am upset we have an unannounced house guest,
so make me cocoa.
%
Sheldon: Don't worry. As you tertiary friend I'm prepared to step in and
comfort you.
Howard: It's not really necessary.
Sheldon: Ah no. I'll finish making the tea while you narcisistically
ramble on about whatever's troubling you.
Howard: Thanks.
Sheldon: That's what tertiary friends are for!
%
Amy: Well, granted Penny your secondary sexual characteristics are
reasonably bodacious but Priya is highly educated, she's an accomplished
professional and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book
on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community
college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping
cows!
%
Amy: (Via Laptop) What up bestie? Good news! Thanks to you I was able to
make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.
Penny: Great.
Amy: So, you feeling better?
Penny: Not really.
Amy: Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.
Sheldon: I'll make tea.
Penny: Sweetie, it's OK. I don't want tea.
Sheldon: It's not optional!
%
Amy: I came as quickly as I could.
Penny: Ok ... why?
Amy: To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating
Rajesh's sister, so I hightailed over here to pick up the pieces of your
broken heart.
Penny: Amy, I'm fine.
Amy: You don't have to be strong for me. Now, let's talk about Priya, that
man-stealing bitch!
%
Howard's Mother: Who's there? Are you a sex criminal!?
Howard: Sex criminals don't have KEYS MA!
%
Sheldon: Studies are shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking
on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces ones reaction
time by the same factors as ounce of alcohol.
%
Sheldon:I was otherwise engaged.
Penny: Doing what?
Sheldon: I was examining perturbutive amplitudes in N=4 supersymeteric
theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of
multiloop N=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral
incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my
size?
Leonard: I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not that.
%
Sheldon: I'm clearly too evolved for driving.
%
Sheldon: We're gonna have to stop at Pottery Barn on our way to work, I
bought these Star Wars sheets, but they turned out to be much too
stimulating to be compatible with a good night's sleep. I don't like the
way Darth Vader stares at me.
%
Sheldon: Just because your career's been stagnant for a few years, that's
no reason to give up.
%
Leonard: Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and you'd have to make
others arrangements?
Sheldon: You did.
Leonard: And?
Sheldon: I didn't!
%
Sheldon: How am I gonna get to work.
Leonard: Take the bus.
Sheldon: But I can't take the bus. They don't have seat belts. And they
won't let you latch yourself to the seat with bungee chords.
Leonard: You tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee chords?
Sheldon: I didn't try, I succeeded. For some reason, it alarmed the other
passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
%
Sheldon: You have to drive me to work.
Penny: Yeah, I really don't think I do.
Sheldon: But I don't drive and I can't take the bus.
Penny: Alright, honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee
chord thing.
%
Sheldon: Your check-engine light is on.
Penny: Mm-hm!
Sheldon: Typically, that's an indicator to, you know, check your engine.
Penny: It's fine, it's been on for, like, a month.
Sheldon: Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know,
check your engine.
Penny: Sheldon, it's fine.
Sheldon: If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on. That's why the
manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it's not fine.
Penny: Maybe the light's broken.
Sheldon: Is there a check-the-check-engine-light light?
%
Sheldon: (Screaming, while hanging onto Howard on his motorbike) Oh, God,
not Euclid Avenue. (screaming continues)
%
Sheldon: Maybe if I turn off the nightlight, I can keep the sheets.
%
Sheldon: I still don't see why I need a drivers license. Albert Einstein
never had a drivers license.
Howard:Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me wet myself at 40 miles an
hour.
Penny: Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts.
%
Sheldon: Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.
DMV Worker: Look at that sign up there.
Sheldon: Yes?
DMV Worker: Does it say "I give a damn?"
Sheldon: No.
DMV Worker: That's because I don't.
%
DMV Worker: Here's your learner's permit. Go away.
Sheldon: But I'm not done. I have many additional concerns about these
questions.
DMV Worker: Don't make me climb over this counter!
%
Sheldon: (To the cleaning ladies) You saw nothing!
%
Sheldon: There are a lot more rich old ladies out there and Daddy needs a
new linear accelerator!
%
Sheldon: An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going?
The drive thru at Jack In The Box?
%
Sheldon: Your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together,
and I'm not above minimizing your window. (Sheldon video chatting with Amy
Farrah Fowler)
%
Sheldon: It's not a touch phobia, it's a germ phobia. If you'd like to put
on a pair of latex gloves I'll let you check me for a hernia.
%
Sheldon: You seem to have forgotten the reason we live together is that
we're best friends. And I've got your back, Jack.
%
Sheldon: I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.
%
Sheldon: (To Leonard) Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless
self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to
actually accomplish something!
%
Amy: Well then, prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing,
this year's donations might go to, say, the Geology department.
Sheldon: Oh no! Not the dirt people!
Amy: Or, worse still, it could go to the liberal arts.
Sheldon: No!
Amy: Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and
students of gender studies.
Sheldon: Oh, the Humanities!
%
Penny: (Gleefully) Good morning, slut!
Leonard: What?
Penny: Oh, please! I recognise the walk of shame when I see it. All you're
missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in
it!
%
Penny: (To Sheldon) We can't keep explaining everything. Read that book we
gave you!
%
Raj: Hands off my sister!
Sheldon: Why would I touch your sister? She's all covered in airplane
germs.
%
Raj: I don't think we're going to do that.
Sheldon: Do you just hate fun?
%
Leonard: I'm sorry.
Raj's sister: Why do you say that?
Leonard: When I'm in bed with a girl, that's just my natural response.
%
Sheldon: And to think, I was about to waste the last of my good
haemorrhoid cream on you!
%
Leonard: I'm the Darth Vadar of Pasadena!
Sheldon: You're far too short to be Darth Vadar!
%
Leonard: Hey, you got Snoopy out! (Referring to the snow cone maker.)
Sheldon: Yes.
Leonard: Can I have one?
Sheldon: Sure.
Leonard: Hmmm. What flavor is this? This is good.
*Leonard guesses a few flavors.*
Sheldon: Papaya caterpillar.
*Leonard spits it out and trashes the rest.*
%
Sheldon: It's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated.
%
Howard: This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten. It tastes like it's
made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
%
Sheldon: I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles,
make it a train day.
Raj: "Train Day?"
Sheldon: The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City, a hot dog
stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an
outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars, and other rolling
stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Then finally, we're off to the glitz
and glamour of Hollywood, for dinner at, that's right, the Hollywood
Carney's, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
Raj: I don't think we're gonna do that.
Sheldon: Well, then apparently, you hate fun.

Sheldon:(typing) Hit troll with axe! Hit troll with axe! Hit troll with
axe! Oh, my, this is one tough troll.
%
Raj: You slept with my sister?
Leonard: Yeah?
Howard: How could you? We had a pact.
Raj: Excuse me, I think "How could you, she's my sister" takes precedence
over a 5-year-old pinkie swear.
%
Raj: I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
Leonard: Well, uh-- I can't believe you'd use Sheldon's toothbrush.
Sheldon: You used my toothbrush?
Raj: Not the brush part. Just the little rubber thing to pick food from my
teeth and massage my gums.
%
Leonard: We're here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman!
%
Sheldon: I often forget other people have limitations. It's so sad.  
Howard: He can feel sadness?  
Leonard: Not really. It's what you and I would call condescension.
%
Sheldon: I'm not insane, my mother had me tested!
%
(Sheldon smiles in a grotesque way).
Howard: Oh...... crap that's terrifying.
%
Sheldon: You know, this situation with Koothrappali brings to mind a story
from my childhood.
Howard: Oh, goody, more tales from the Panhandle.
Sheldon: That's Northwest Texas. I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region.
Home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.
Leonard: Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
Sheldon: No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery Ward delivery van ran
over our family cat, Lucky.
Howard: Lucky?
Sheldon: Yes, Lucky.
Leonard: He's irony-impaired. Just move on.
Howard: Ok, dead cat named Lucky. Continue.
%
Raj: Welcome to the Raj Majal.
%
Raj: Boy, I bet Ellen Page's friends aren't giving her this kind of crap!
%
Sheldon: Hey! Look I found my missing nutrino!
Howard: Oh, great! We can take it off the milk carton!
%
Raj: Dr. Gablehouser.
Dr. Gablehouser: Dr. Koothrapali.
Leonard: Dr. Gablehouser.
Dr. Gablehouser: Dr. Hofstadter.
Sheldon: Dr. Gablehouser.
Dr. Gablehouser: Dr. Cooper.
Howard: Dr. Gablehouser.
Dr. Gablehouser: Mr. Wolowitz
%
Sheldon: In Papa New Guinea, there's a tribe when a hunter flaunts his
success to the rest of the village, they kill him and drive away evil
spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense, of course,
but one can see their point.
%
Sheldon: A truck ran over our cat Lucky.
%
Raj: So, Saturday night ... can I count on my posse?
Howard: Jeez, I'd love to Raj but I can't make it.
Raj: Ah, ok, Leonard?
Leonard: Oah, aah, oh, I can ... no!
Raj: Sheldon?
Sheldon: I can make it but I won't.
%
Leonard: [On Sheldon's smile] We're here to cheer up Koothrappali, not
kill Batman.
%
Raj:Hey, buddy, I'm gonna be in People Magazine.
Charlie Sheen: Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.
%
Raj: I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?
%
Penny: Bug report: when a guy asks me to spend some time with him, maybe
he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home and
watching TV.
Leonard: Even Doctor Who?
Penny: Even Doctor Who.
%
Sheldon: Now, today's episode of 'Fun with Flags' is not fun. But it is
important: Flags. You gotta know how to hold 'em, you gotta know how to
fold 'em.
%
Leonard: I play Grand Theft Auto. I know about gats ... *gun fires*
%
Leonard: So, I've got a gunshot wound. That's pretty bad-ass.
Penny: No, you've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your
pinky toe.
%
Raj: I can't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.
%
Bernadette: Who's Siri? Is he dating someone new?
Howard: Yes, his phone.
Bernadette: Is that cute? Or creepy?
%
Leonard: Can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are "stupid"? No,
never mind. It's right here.
%
Raj: I'd like for you to call me sexy.
Siri: [chimes] From now on, I'll call you sexy. Okay?
Raj: Okay!
%
Amy: Her heart's full of love, no one cares what's in her mouth.
%
Leonard: It's color-coded. Red means "fix right away" Yellow is "eh,
whenever you get a chance." And, green is "I could probably learn to live
with it."
%
Howard: She (Siri) is gonna break his heart.
%
Howard: [Chuckles] Look at that. There's finally a woman in your life you
can talk to.
%
Raj: Whoa! What's your hurry, cowboy? Savor the moment.
*Raj and Howard slowly remove the plastic off Raj's new iPhone 4S*
Howard: Oh, yeah.
%
Penny: You mean like a beta test?
Leonard: Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test
requires people that weren't involved in the development of the appli....
Penny: Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?
Leonard: No, absolutely you should.
%
Leonard: I missed you.
Penny: You see me all the time. You sure you don't just miss the sex?
Leonard: Well, yeah, the sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried
it?
Penny: I have. You're not wrong.
%
Kripke: Can you wecommend a westuwant?
Siri: I'm sorry I don't understand "wecommend a westuwant."
%
Penny: (To Raj) Really still can't talk to me?
%
Leonard: What are you doing here?
Raj: I was sleeping!
Leonard: In my bed?
Raj: Well, I would have slept in my own bed, but it was being used to
bring shame to my family ... and the memory of Gene Roddenberry!
%
Sheldon: Will you Boozehounds stop that infernal clinking? ... and the
Answer was Elephant.
%
Raj: Can I bring girls here?
Leonard: You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
Raj: Okay, deal.
Leonard: Just not against their will.
%
Raj: Come on, dude, I'm exhausted and Tyra Banks says the most important
item in your makeup bag is a good night's sleep.
%
Leonard: (In the bedroom with Priya) Open the landing bay doors, shuttle
craft approaching.
%
Sheldon: I never joke about safety.
%
Sheldon: What are you doing here?
Leonard: I live here.
Sheldon: I have paperwork that says differently.
%
Sheldon: Oh Amy, I've never been touched like this before.
%
Sheldon: My hands are magic.
%
Leonard: If I role down the windows, everything is peachy. If you role
down the windows, you're still not a doctor.
%
Penny: So that means, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor,
you're a doctor and ... Howard you know a lot of doctors.
%
Sheldon: What are you doing here?
Howard: I've been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
Sheldon: Why?
Howard: She bought me a nice watch.
Sheldon: Leonard, do you understand any of this?
Leonard: Yes.
Sheldon: Talk to him.
%
Penny: What do you mean 'new roommate'? What happened to Leonard?
Sheldon: Same thing that happened to 'Homo Erectus'. He was replaced by a
superior species.
Raj: I'm the new homo in town...
%
Amy: I was proposing massaging your muscles with your own hands.
Sheldon: Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
%
Raj: It's better to have loved and lost than to downloading increasingly
shameful pornography.
%
Amy: I study the brain, the organ reponsible for Beethoven's 5th Symphony.
Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Light.
%
Sheldon: Here's an interesting fact about alcohol: Man is not the only
species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess
what the other is? Hint: sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
Penny: Monkeys.
Sheldon: When does a monkey have a trunk?
Penny: When a suitcase just won't do.
%
Howard: You gotta like this: the girlfriend, the ex-girlfriend, bonding
over your rooty-tooty stinky booty? (All but Leonard laugh)
Leonard: Kill me!
Sheldon: It wouldn't help. The human body is capable of being flatulent
for hours after death.
%
Penny: Sheldon have you changed your wireless password again?
Sheldon: Yes, it's "Penny get your own WiFi"; no spaces.
%
Raj: Just think of me as a Brown Martha Stewart.
%
Sheldon: When does a monkey have a trunk?
Penny: When a suitcase just won't do.
%
Mr. Koothrappali: We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City, is that
close to you?
Priya: No!
%
Leonard: So...hot in India?
Mr. Koothrappali: Of course it is, it always is. It's India. Now, what do
have to say for yourself?
Leonard: Uh...that is a beautiful tapestry.
(Raj's parents look back, Leonard closes laptop)
%
Leonard: What's going on?
Penny: Oh, heh, it's not what it looks like. *Leaving*
Sheldon: What does it look like?
%
Sheldon: Wil Wheaton ... the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek Universe.
%
Sheldon: Knock Knock.
Leonard: Who's there?
Sheldon: Hugh.
Leonard: Hugh who?
Sheldon: Hugh guys ought to listen to me.
%
Sheldon: No butts, no cuts, no coconuts.
%
Penny: I can't believe you've never read "Eat, Pray, Love".
Leonard: When she comes out with "Eat, Pray, Runaway from a giant
boulder", I'll read it.
%
Leonard: Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
%
Howard: I'm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that too.
(Talking to Raj about Leonard and Penny's former relationship)
%
Sheldon: This is where we could've been if we hadn't stopped for dinner.
(Points at place in long line) This is where we could've been if
Koothrapali hadn't ordered dessert. (Points again)
Raj: I earned it, I ate all my brocolli.
%
Raj: Guys, I just did a quick calculation. Judging by the size of the
theater and this line we may not get in.
(Sheldon wakes up and jumps out of his chair.)
Sheldon: What did he say?
Leonard: Nice going, Raj. I just got him down for his nap.
%
*Sheldon receives a cell phone call*
Sheldon: Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone
quality but go on. Test phrases. Alright. I'm a tote. Olba. Twad. All
together? All right. I'm a total butt wad. Why are you laughing? Hello?
Penny: And that girls is how you make a phony phone call.
%
(Raj whistles to try find Sheldon in the theater)
Howard: We're looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke!
%
Sheldon: Under normal circumstances I'd say I told you so. But, as I have
told so with such vehemence and frequency already the phrase has lost all
meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase, I have
informed you thusly.
%
Bernadette: Besides, Penny and I are having a girl's night tonight
Amy: Girls night, what does that entail?
Bernadette: Oh you know, girls get together hang out share girl talk.
Amy: I'm a girl.
Bernadette: Oh well maybe you could join us. I'll ask Penny.
Amy: No need, Penny and I are very close
Leonard: You are?
Amy: Yes, In fact our menses are synchronized.
%
Penny: All right, time to open bachelor number two.
%
Sheldon: Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Jar-Jar Binks of the Star Trek
Universe!
Wil Wheaton: (Imitating Jar-Jar) Me-sa think that's funny!
%
Sheldon: I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity
implausible. And also it's really scary.
%
Sheldon: Trouble is my middle name Leonard. Actually it's Lee but I prefer
Trouble.
Wil Wheaton: Oh, look who they let in.
Sheldon: Don't worry Wil Wheaton, I was just leaving. *Holds up the movie
can and runs off*
%
Penny: Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that
good with a whip?
Howard: Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That's how I
learned.
%
Sheldon: May I point out to you all that the screening is first come,
first served?
Leonard: Relax, it's 5:00. The movie doesn't start till midnight.
Sheldon: Another way of saying that is: the movie starts at midnight and
it's already 5:00. Let's go.
%
Leonard: Uh, I hope they let us in soon. I'm tired of running to the gas
station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time.
It's a vicious circle.
Howard: Too bad you don't have a stadium pal like me.
Leonard: What's a stadium pal?
Howard: Let me put it this way. Takes care of the bathroom problem and it
keeps your calf warm.
%
Sheldon: Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting: "Best seats in house
for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."
Leonard: Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it's gonna upset you.
Sheldon: I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at
the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting
Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy?
%
Sheldon: (Running from the angry mob) Why is there never a pontoon plane
when you need one?
%
Sheldon: Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we
don't.
Movie Attendant: Because I'm the petty functionary with the clipboard,
bitch.
%
Raj: I'm glad men are wearing hats again. They are so distinguished.
%
Amy: I'll let you in on a little secret. Originally, we were painted nude.
But I had him add clothes cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge
to our heterosexuality.
Penny: Yeah, good call.
Amy: But, if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm,
soapy water and a couple of sponges.
Penny: You're talking about the painting, right?
Amy: Sure.
%
Sheldon: I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples
tear through my shirt.
%
Amy: Goodnight, Painting Penny. Goodnight, Real Penny.
Penny: Goodnight, Real Amy.
Amy: You don't have to say goodnight to Painting Amy, because she's never
leaving.
Bernadette: Goodnight, Real Penny. Goodnight, Transvestite Penny.
%
Leonard: It's going to be difficult to find something you are both equally
good at.
Raj: Is there anything you are both equally bad at?
Sheldon and Kripke: Sports.
%
Penny: It's kind of heavy.
Bernadette: Too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.
%
Kripke: Well, as long as we're here, I might as well take a leak.
Sheldon: Kripke ... you're in my spot.
%
Sheldon: If you're interested I can send you a link to a YouTube video
that would show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Helpful hint:
trim your nails first.
%
President Siebert: Now? You realize I'm your boss and I'm holding my
penis.
%
Amy: Before I met you, I was a mousey wallflower. But look at me now. I'm
like some kind of downtown-hipster-party girl with a posse, a boyfriend
and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things!
%
Howard: It's the twenty first century, you can't have a duel.
%
Leonard: Hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?
%
Sheldon: As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in
mind, I propose the following: I will take Rothman's office... and you
will find a way to be okay with that.
Kripke: How about I take Rothman's office and you go suck a wemon?
%
Sheldon: I don't know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that
attractive and this skilled at a videogame.
%
Leonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a
couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Penny: Or we could just have a life.
%
Penny: (Barges into apartment) Hey, guys! My friends and I got tired of
dancing so we came over to have sex with you.
(The guys continue to play Halo).
Penny: Told ya.
(Penny and her friends leave).
Sheldon: Why did you hit pause?
Leonard: I thought I heard something. 
Rajesh: What?
Leonard: No, never mind.
%
Leonard: If you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
Penny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my
brother, so she's kind of family.
%
Leonard: Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut
Raj in half.
Rajesh: Oh, great cut the foreign guy in half. There's a billion more
where that came from.
%
Penny: Wait, wait, Sheldon come back, you forgot something.
Sheldon: What?
Penny: This plasma grenade... HA look, it's raining YOU!
%
Sheldon: I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this
point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
%
Leonard: (While playing Halo) Wow Penny, you're on fire!
Penny:Yeah, so is Sheldon!
%
Raj: Not only are there thousands of people starving in India, there's an
Indian starving right here!
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst! Who needs Halo when we
can be regaled delightfully with the folksy tale of the 'whore of Omaha'?!
%
Penny: OK, I have a problem!
Sheldon: It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly, you
deserve it.
%
Penny: Anything else?
Sheldon: Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I will jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
%
Sheldon: If we're all through playing "Mock the Flawed Technology", can we
get on with Halo Night? We were supposed to start at 8, it is now 8:06.
%
(Penny Knocks)
Sheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?
%
Howard: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day, you'll have good luck.
Penny: No, you won't.
%
Penny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more
serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo".
%
Sheldon:One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. We play teams, not
one-on-one. (to himself) One-on-one!
%
Sheldon: The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is
a notion, and a rather sucky one.
%
Penny:(Playing Halo) Cool! Whose head did I just blow off?
Sheldon: Mine!
%
Sheldon: Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of
experience, not to mention-- *Explosion on game*
Penny: Ha-ha! There goes your head again.
Sheldon: Okay, it's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just
re-spawned. You need to give them a chance to--*Explosion on game*
Sheldon: (Grabbing his controller) Now, come on!
%
Penny: I grew up on a farm, from what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
%
Leonard: You have a TV in your room, why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Sheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's
Day.
%
Howard: By the way, where did you get that loofa mitt? Yours reaches
places that mine just won't.
Penny: You used my loofa?
Howard: More precisely, we used your loofa. I exfoliated her BRAINS OUT!
%
Christy: Mm! There's my little engine that could.
*Howard makes train noise*
Sheldon: There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
%
Howard: When they perfect human cloning, I'm gonna order 12 of those.
(Talking about Christy)
%
Penny:She'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
Howard: Really?
Penny: Yeah!
Howard: YAY! If you'll excuse me, I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
%
Chen: Hi, fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he
speaks Mandarin?
Sheldon: He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he
comes from, that's punishable by death.
Chen: I come from Sacramento.
%
Sheldon: You can't make a half sandwich. If it's not half of a whole
sandwich, it's just a small sandwich.
%
Sheldon: Stop it both of you! All this fighting, I might as well be back
with my parents!
*Imitating his Mom* Dammit George! I told you if you didn't quit drinking
I would leave you!
*Imitating his Dad* Well, I guess that makes you a liar, because I'm drunk
as hell and you are still here!
*Imitating his Mom* Stop yelling, you're making Sheldon cry!
*Imitating his Dad* I'll tell you what is making Sheldon cry, that I let
you name him SHELDON!
%
Raj: Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? It's rice!
%
Sheldon: I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not
to talk to her, and now look. We're going to be late for the movies.
%
Rajesh: Excuse me but I don't think Penny is out of line at all. You don't
own her. It's like my girl Beyonce says: If you like you should've put a
ring on it.
%
Leonard:What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I'm cool with having your
old boyfriend sleep in your apartment.
Leonard imitating Penny: Well, Leonard, it does'nt matter if you're cool
or not, 'cause I'm penny and I'm pretty and I can do whatever the hell I
want.
%
Sheldon: I want that one.
%
Sheldon: Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me
half of someone else's sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone in the
restaurant to order the other half?
%
Wolowitz: I said I was sorry!
Rajesh: Sorry doesn't make up for the fact that I had to cook chicken and
rice with this vegan guy. You know what vegan chicken and rice is? RICE!
Wolowitz: Do you think I'dve rather been with you or sitting around for
hours listening to my mother saying "Have y'ever peed so much in yor
life??"
Rajesh: Oh, you are such a momma's boy!
Wolowitz: Don't bring my mother into this.
Rajesh: YOU brought your mother into this!!
%
Penny: Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.
Sheldon: Oh, Research Lab is more than just a game. It's like the slogan
says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.
%
Sheldon: What exactly does that expression mean, 'friends with benefits?'
Does he provide her with health insurance?
%
Sheldon: You know, I'm given to understand that there's an entire city in
Nevada devoted specifically to help people like Howard forget their
problems. They replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling
addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.
%
Wolowitz: Raj, there's no place for truth on the Internet.
%
Leonard: What were you doing at Penny's?
Sheldon: Well, we had dinner, played some games, and then I spent the
night. Oh, and you'll be happy to know that I now have a much better
understanding of 'friends with benefits.'
%
Raj: What do you say Howard?
Howard: I say Vegas baby!
Raj: What are you gonna tell your mother?
Howard: Sea World baby!
%
Sheldon: You know I'm in such a good mood I'm actually finding your
tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.
%
Raj: Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on Earth.
%
Sheldon: Penny.
Penny: What?
Sheldon: I can't sleep.
Penny: Maybe that's because your hole is still open.
%
Sheldon: Penny.
Penny: Yeah.
Sheldon: Thanks for letting me stay here.
Penny: Oh, you're welcome sweetie.
Sheldon: Okay, I'm sleepy now get out.
%
Sheldon: There was a tall man from Cornwall
Whose length exceeded his bed.
"My body fits on it
But barely upon it
There's no room for my big Cornish head!"
%
Raj: She is exactly Howard's type. A hooker.
%
Hooker: What's your name?
Raj: Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Hooker: Hello Rajesh Ram...Hello Rajesh.
%
Sheldon: We have a bowl. Our keys are in the bowl. You shoud get bowl
Penny: I just don't understand; how can beautyful mind of Sheldon Cooper
forget his keys in the first place?
Sheldon: I left them in the bowl.
%
Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?
Sheldon: I'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my
auditory canal.
%
Sheldon: YOU'RE THE MILK THIEF! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that
carton felt lighter.
%
Penny: Mmm, what smells so good?
Sheldon: That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer. A perfect
culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it
Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping
of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97-pound blister.
And finally, it's main ingredient is paneer, a farmer's cheese that cause
Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.
%
Howard: There's no place for truth on the internet.
%
Howard: (Answering phone) You've reached "Friends with Benefits", for a
booty call, press 1 now.
%
Raj: (Reading Howard's tweet) I am so lonely and horny, I may open this
$20 jar of peanuts and end it all.
%
Sheldon: That's preposterous. I do not resemble C-3PO. Don't get me wrong,
I'm flattered. I just don't see it.
%
Howard: I say "Vegas, baby."
Raj: What are you gonna tell your mother?
Howard: Seaworld, baby.
%
Sheldon: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time,
my mother would read [The Monkey and the Princess] to me. It's about an
Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite
strongly.
Penny: I know the reason.
Leonard: We all know the reason.
%
Penny: I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon: Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you can try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest
white mice? Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
Penny: I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of
talking to you.
Leonard: His mom's been saying that for years.
%
Leonard: Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of America
Membership card? 
Sheldon: It's been in every wallet I owned since I was five. 
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here
under Batman's signature.
%
Sheldon: I'll have a diet Coke.
Penny: Can you please order a cocktail? I need to practice mixing drinks.
Sheldon: Fine... I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.
Penny: That's... rum and Coke without the rum.
Sheldon: Yes, and would you make it diet?
%
Rajesh: How can I be a gynecologist? I can barely look a woman in the
eye!!
%
Leonard: What got into him?
Penny: Oh, a couple of virgin Cuba Libres who turned out to be a little
slutty.
Leonard: You didn't.
Penny: You do your little experiments, I do mine.
%
Sheldon: How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to
life?
Wolowitz: Every year at ComiCon. Every day at Disneyland. You can hire
Snow White to come to your house. Of course they prefer if you have a kid.
%
Penny: Ok, here you go Leonard. One tequila sunrise!
Leonard: Thank you! You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical
container!
%
Penny: I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar-tending shift,
so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Leonard: That's Great! The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is
repetition.
Sheldon:With certain obvious exceptions,
*Leonard and Penny Look at Sheldon.*
Sheldon: Suicide for example.
%
Raj: Stop hitting on my lady or you shall experience my wrath.
Sheldon: I am not hitting on her.
Lalita: And I am not your Lady.
Howard: And you have no wrath.
%
Mr .Koothrappali: Tilt up the camera, I'm looking at his crotch.
Raj: Sorry, Papa!
%
Raj: What just happened?
Leonard: Beats the hell outta me!
Howard: I'll tell you what happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian
Chicks.
%
Penny: Anybody need a refill?
Raj: (Drunk) Where did my life go, Penny?
*Everyone realizes Raj spoke to Penny.*
Raj: One day, I'm a carefree bachelor, the next, I'm driving a minivan to
peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Penny: Are you talking to me?
Raj: Is there another Penny here?
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: What are we suppose to tell Lalita's parents?
Mr. Koothrappali: I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at
him.
Raj: Why don't you keep your eye on the ball, Papa?
%
Sheldon: A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime
wedge in it.
Penny: Then swim to cuba.
Sheldon: Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
%
Mrs. Koothrappali: You are wearing the boxers we sent you, Rajesh?
Raj: Yes!
Mrs. Koothrappali: Because you know what happens to the samosas when you
wear the tighty-whities.
Raj: Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
%
Sheldon: Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: What happened?
Sheldon: Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
%
Howard: Is it me or does web-chatting with your clothes on seem a little
pointless?
%
Raj: I don't believe it!
Howard: Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
%
Sheldon: Damn you, walletnook.com!
Leonard: Problem?
Sheldon: The online description was completely misleading. They said 8
slots plus removable ID. To any rational person, that would mean room for
nine cards. But they don't tell you, the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare!
%
Howard: So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon: No need. We have the special edition.
Leonard: Well, maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
%
Sheldon: (On the phone) This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel
my membership to the planetarium. Yeah, well, I'm sorry too, but there's
just no room for you in my wallet. No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have
dinosaurs. Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-Bye!
%
Sheldon: Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to
stop.
%
Raj: You have lost so much weight. That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat. Do you remember?
Lalita: Yes I do.
Raj: Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
Lalita: Well I've been trying...
%
Sheldon: I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Lalita: Really? So do I!
Raj: But, you're a dentist, he's nuts!
%
Leonard: You're a woman, and I'm going to make you feel things you have
never felt before. That's right, say my name, and beg me for more because
I'm going to give it to you!
%
Penny: (To Sheldon) We are like an old married couple!
%
Penny: (Answering the door to Sheldon) What's up, buttercup?
Penny: (Answering the door again) What's the word, hummingbird?
Penny: (And again) What's the gist, physicist?
%
Sheldon: (Freaking Out at Penny's Chair) I'm sitting on garbage!
%
Amy: Kiss me where I've never been kissed before?
Sheldon: You mean like Salt Lake City?
%
Sheldon: If your video's frozen try re-setting the TCP/IP stack
%
Amy: You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behavior is symptomatic
of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?
Sheldon: Is not. Is not, is not.
Amy: Denial. Denial, denial.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, you do this all the time! You fixate on some crazy idea
then blow it way out of proportion.
Sheldon: Name one time I've done that?
Leonard: How about the time you put GPS trackers in your garbage because
you thought North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken
nuggets you thought were human nuggets? The mysterious cloud that was
following you around town? Or the time you put my shirt on by accident and
thought you were growing again?
Sheldon: I said name one, you need to work on your listening.
%
Sheldon: *Knock knock knock* Penny,
*Knock knock knock* Penny,
Penny: What's the jist, physicist?
%
Sheldon: You keep in mind that my sharply-worded comments on Yelp.com
recently took down a muffin store.
%
Raj: With your American accent, everything you say sounds stupid!
%
Raj: If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I
would be their king.
Leonard: I hate my name. It has 'nerd' in it. 'Len. Nerd.'
Wolowitz: I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
Raj: I would be kind to my rabbit subjects ...  at first.
%
Sheldon: Why do you have the Chinese character for 'soup' tattooed on your
right buttock?
Penny: It's not 'soup'; it's 'courage'.
Sheldon: No it isn't. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate
that kind of commitment to soup.
Penny: How'd you see it? You said you wouldn't look.
Sheldon: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.
%
Sheldon: Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a
muscle relaxer, so don't operate heavy machinery, and try not to choke on
your own drool.
*Sheldon is is about to leave.*
Penny: Wait! You have to help me get into bed. (laughs) "Sheldon has to
help me get into bed". Bet you thought I'd never say that!
Sheldon: Yes. Charmed, your drug-addled candour knows no bounds.
*Sheldon follows her to her room after shutting the door. He pulls down
the covers to help Penny into bed.*
Penny: You know people think you are this weird robot man who's so
annoying all the time and you totally are. But then it's like that movie
Wall-E at the end. You're so full of love and you can save a plant and get
fat people out of their floaty chairs.
Sheldon: Thats a fairly laboured metaphor but I appreciate the sentiment
behind it.
Penny: Sing 'Soft Kitty' to me.
Sheldon: 'Soft kitty' is for when you're sick, you're not sick.
Penny: Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
Sheldon: (sitting on the bed next to her) Soft Kitty, warm kitty, little
ball of fur...
Penny: Wait wait. Lets sing it as a round. I'll start. Soft Kitty, warm
kitty, little ball of fur... *Sheldon doesn't join in.*
Penny: So that is when you come in. I'll start over. Soft Kitty, warm
kitty, little ball of fur... Still nothing from Sheldon.
Penny: I've got all night Sheldon. *She starts again.*
Penny: Soft Kitty, warm kitty...
Sheldon: Soft Kitty, warm kitty... *They both sing the entire song
together.*
%
Sheldon: Cause of Injury: Lack of Adhesive Ducks.
%
*Sheldon is about to knock on Penny's bathroom door*
Penny: Don't you dare knock!
%
Sheldon: Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of
a damsel in distress!
%
Sheldon: And good evening to you, Siam Palace, this is Sheldon Cooper.
Yeah, I'm going to be dining alone this evening, so I'll be reducing my
usual order. I'd like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers
plate and one half of the Golden Treasure for two - oh, for heaven's sake!
In the mid-18th century, King Rama the Fourth of Siam divided a huge
empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his
throne. Surely you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and
dumplings!
%
Wolowitz: Even now,I can't look at pickled herring without being aroused
and ashamed.
%
Raj: And then, when he woke up, it was ... HIS SISTER!
%
Wolowitz: You're such a doosh.
Raj: Who cares!? You slept with your cousin!
%
Sheldon: I'm sorry.
There there, everythings gonna be okay........
Sheldon's here!
%
Sheldon: There there, everything is going to be fine... Sheldon's here!
%
Sheldon: I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties
do you wear on Mondays?
Penny: I don't need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.
Sheldon: My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case
one is in an accident.
Penny: One was already in an accident.
Sheldon: Doesn't mean one won't be in another, especially if I'm driving.
%
Penny: You gotta help me get my arm into my sleeve.
Sheldon: (Eyes closed) Okay!
Penny: Is that my arm?
Sheldon: It doesn't feel like an arm.
Penny: Then maybe you should let it go.
%
Howard: (At campsite, lamenting) 1. I lost my virginity to my cousin,
Jeanie. 2. It was my Uncle Murray's funeral, we were all back at my Aunt
Barbara's house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant
for it to happen. 3. To this day, I can't look at pickled herring without
being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.
%
Penny: Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.
Sheldon: Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science
officer. And I guarantee you that if he saw the Enterprise's "Check
Engine" light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.
%
Sheldon: (To Penny) According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind
the desk, you'll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart
attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone.
%
Kurt: Where's your back up?
Leonard: I don't need back up, I have right on my side...and I'm wearing
cargo shorts under my pants.
%
Howard: Maybe we should have your head notarized.
%
Leonard: OK, is everyone clear on the plan?
Howard: Yes, Koothrappali's going to wet himself, I'm gonna throw up,
Sheldon's gonna run away and you're going to die.
%
Sheldon: There once was a brave lad named Leonard
With a fi fi fiddle dee dee
He faced a fearsome giant
While Raj just wanted to pee
%
Penny: What are you saying? That I'm using my body to get dinner? That I'm
some sort of Chinese food prostitute?
%
Penny: No, I can't. Sheldon, honey, I don't want things to be weird
between us.
Sheldon: Won't it also be 'weird' if I have to say hello to you every
morning on my way to work and you're living in a refrigerator box and
washing your hair with rainwater?
%
Raj: If anyone cares, I still have to pee.
%
Leonard: Does everyone know the plan?
Howard: Yeah, Raj is gonna wet himself, I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon is
gonna run away, and you are going to die.
%
Leonard: Come on, there's four of us and one of him.
Sheldon: Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write
songs about him.
%
Leonard: Sheldon, would you be prepared on a non-presidential basis, to
create an emergency ad-hoc slurpee/icee equivalency?
Sheldon: Oh Leonard, you know I can't do that.
%
Sheldon: I'm sorry but I'm not going to watch the Clone Wars TV Series
until I've seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas
disappoint me in the order he intended.
%
Sheldon: I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of
excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of
propulsion.
%
Sheldon: Rock - Paper - Scissors - Lizard - Spock
%
Leonard: How can 5 not be worse than 1?
Rajesh: Yeah, Star Trek 5 worse than 1.
Sheldon: Ok, first of all that is a comparison of quality not intensity.
Secondly, Star Trek 1 is orders of magnatude worse than Star Trek 5.
Rajesh: Are you joking? Star Trek 5 is the standard against which all
badness is messured!
%
Sheldon: Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard,
lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it
always has, rock crushes scissors.
%
Sheldon: How is Deep Space 9 better than Saturn 3?
Raj: Simple subtraction will tell you it's six better
%
Rajesh: Oh,snap.
Sheldon: Snap what?
%
Howard: Mars rover, Mars rover can Howard come over?
%
Stephanie: So, how was your day?
Leonard: Y'know, I'm a physicist - I thought about stuff.
Stephanie: That's it?
Leonard: I wrote some of it down.
%
Howard: There must be another way.
Raj: You could try calling AAA ... but based on NASA's latest timetable,
they wouldn't be out there for another 35 years.
Sheldon: Plus, I understand you need to be standing next to the vehicle
with your card when they arrive.
%
Howard: I got the Mars-rover stuck in the ditch.
Sheldon: Where?
Howard: On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield... Where do you
think?! On Mars!
%
Howard: May I say Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do
with such greasy hair.
%
Sheldon: Doesn't anyone wanna know where he's (Leonard) going?
Penny: Okay, where is he going?
Sheldon: (Unconvincingly) Leonard is going to the office.
%
Sheldon: Will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is
inarguably the best?
Raj: I have 3 words for you: Wrath of Khan.
%
Leonard: Just out of curiosity, did he (Howard) ever have a shot with you?
Stephanie: Are you insane, the guy was wearing an eyepatch.
Leonard: So, then why did you--
Stephanie: He said I could drive a car on Mars!
%
Howard: (Example chat-up line) Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth,
but on you they work.
%
Sheldon: So, just to clarify, when you say 3, do we stand up or do we pee?
%
Howard: I'll bet your Meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother, I
bet she had sex because she liked it.
Sheldon: Stop it!
Raj: Yeah! Meemaw did the nasty!
Sheldon: I said stop it!
Howard: We're getting to him.
%
Wolowitz: Where's my dad, puppet?!
%
Penny: Who's Adam West?
Sheldon: Who's Adam West!? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about
after the coitus?
%
Leonard: *Doing Mr. T impression while holding a action figure of Spock
with Mr. T's head* I pity the fool who's illogical!
%
Penny: I need to go back to dating dumb guys from the gym...
%
(after discovering the "Lord of the Rings"-ring)
Sheldon: One ring to rule them all.
Rajesh: One ring to find them.
Wolowitz: One ring to bring them all.
Leonard: And in the darkness bind them.
(...silence...)
Rajesh: Holy crap are we nerdy!
%
Leonard: What was that?
Penny: Sheldon tried to steal the ring so I punched him.
Leonard: That's my girl!
%
Sheldon: You hit me. I'm bleeding.
%
Sheldon: (To Penny) What's sad is you don't know who TV's Adam West is.
%
Sheldon: Where's the ring?
Leonard: It's in a Fedex box on it's way back to where it came from.
Rajesh: The fires of Mount Doom?
%
*After pulling the blanket back and seeing that Leonard has the ring
around his neck*
Sheldon: Give us the Precious!
%
Sheldon: Oh, here's a fun fact! Ketchup started out as a general term for
sauce, typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices.
Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster,
kidney bean, and grape.
%
Howard: So Sheldon, how's it feel to be beaten up by a girl?
Sheldon: It's not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults
began at utero.
%
Penny: That is so sad.
Sheldon: No, What's sad is that you don't know Adam West is TV's Batman.
%
Leonard: Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
Sheldon: Well, it's very simple. In our ragtag of scientists with nothing
to lose, I'm the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is
the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails, and
that leaves you, by default, as the muscle.
Leonard: One more floor, and I'd be the pulled muscle.
%
Todd Zarnecki: Who is it?
Sheldon: Your doom!
%
Penny: Give my friend his stuff back.
Tod Zarnecki: I don't know what you're talking about.
Penny: Well then good news! Today's the day a girl's finally going to
touch you in your little special place. *Kicks him in the groin*
%
Sheldon: Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?
%
Sheldon: I've never said these words before, but good job Howard!
%
Penny: Amy is right, I do wanna fling my poop at her.
%
Sheldon: They also took Glen.
Leonard: No, not Glen.
Sheldon: Yes, the only bird that I ever loved.
%
Raj: Come on, dude, bros before (pause )my sister.
%
Sheldon: We did it! .... What? I said we!
%
Leonard: I can't believe we're going all the way to San Diego to confront
this guy.
Howard: Yeah, we're kind of badasses, aren't we?
%
Howard: (Referring to Sheldon's weapon) Why did you bring that?
Sheldon: No weapon strikes more fear into a man's heart than a Klingon
bat'leth.
%
Cop: Your friend called 911 to report a robbery.
Leonard: Oh, my God, what did they get?
Sheldon: What didn't they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my Vicious
Gladiator armor, my Wand of Untaimed Power and all my gold.
%
Leonard:You called the police because someone hacked your "World of
Warcraft" account?
Sheldon:What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf,
hero of the Eastern Kingdoms, has been picked clean like a carcass is the
desert sun. Plus the FBI hung up on me.
%
Sheldon: This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity.
It is time to cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.
%
Sheldon: 3000 hours! 3000 hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons
and gold. It's almost as if it was a huge waste of time.
%
Sheldon:Excuse me, Penny, but "Doodle Jump" is a game. "Angry Birds" is a
game. "World of Warcraft" is a massively multiplaying online
role-playing... All right, technically it's a game.
%
Sheldon: I'm hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.
%
Sheldon: *Sees Leonard & Penny kissing* Oh, frickity frack! Not this
again!
%
Leonard: Did you get to play with Rajesh's big Telescope last night?
*Rajesh and Wolowitz Freak out*
Wolowitz: Where did that come from?
Rajesh: He never touched my telescope!
%
Sheldon: As usual, you're all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel
universe is the doctor that gives Wolverine his prostate exam.
Howard: How about the guy gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
%
Sheldon: I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together, and if
I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will.
%
Howard: Don't be oversensitive. He's calling you illiterate, not your
race.
Raj: Oh, okay. Good.
%
Sheldon: I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the
classics: regular and Klingon.
Howard: Actually, Indian Monopoly is just like regular. Except the money
is in rupees and instead of hotels, you build call centers. And when you
pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.
%
Leonard: You'll never guess what just happened.
Sheldon: You went out into the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional
portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, which you took
advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now
you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we
transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled
dolphins.
%
Sheldon: Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over
again and expecting different results. By that definition, Penny is cuckoo
for Cocoa Puffs.
%
*Leonard is kissing Penny, and Penny's dad enters*
Penny: Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.
Penny's dad: Relax, I've seen her do a lot worse with a lot stupider.
%
Sheldon: Do you even think about other people, Leonard?
%
Howard: Aah, this takes me back! Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean,
don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff but, once in a while, it's nice
to hear the hits.
Raj: Ooh, ooh, do "our babies will be smart and beautiful." That one
always makes me laugh!
%
Sheldon: I'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate
agreement, specifically to address Penny's annoying personal habits.
Penny: Oh my God! What personal habits?
Sheldon: I have a list. FYI overuse of the phrase "Oh my God" is number
%
Leonard: How'd it go last night?
Raj: Y'know, same old same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some
stars. Big whoop!
%
(Speaking to Leonard)
Penny's Dad: I want grandkids before I die and I want 'em to grow up in a
house without wheels!
%
Raj: Excuse me, I can't be drinking, I'm about to make an important
scientific discovery here!
Howard:What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine!
Raj: How do you know that?
Howard: He was Italian, it's a reasonable assumption.
Raj: Dude, can you even open your mouth without saying a cultural
stereotype?
Howard: I'm sorry Galileo drank diet sprite!
%
Sheldon: Hello, I know you're out there. I can hear you metabolizing
oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide.
%
Sheldon: Get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here's your anus.
%
Sheldon: What self-important preening fraud are they honoring this year?
Leonard: I'm so glad you asked it like that. You!
%
Wolowitz: Well, no you're mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What
you can't do is shut up.
%
Sheldon: Where are my pants?
Leonard: You might wanna check out YouTube.
%
Sheldon: Question: Where are my Pants?
%
Sheldon: A neutron walks into a bar and asks how much for a drink. The
bartender replies "for you, no charge".
%
Sheldon: Oh, Lord, this can't be more humiliating!
Leonard: No, no, no, give him a minute.
%
Sheldon: Why did the chicken cross the Mobius Strip? To get to the same
side! Bazinga!
%
Sheldon: This alcohol is not working, I still feel dizzy.
Penny: Here, try this one.
%
Raj: These methods of meditation come from the ancient gurus of India, and
have helped me overcome my own fears.
Sheldon: And yet, you can't speak to women.
Raj: True, but thanks to it, I am able to stay in the same room with then
without urinating.
%
Penny: So what do you say Sheldon, are we your X-men?
Sheldon: No, the X-men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am
Sheldon Cooper, you will be, my C-men.
%
Raj: In Avatar when they have sex on Pandora they hook up their ponytails
so we know their ponytails are like their junk.
Wolowitz: Yeah, so?
Raj: So when they fly horses or fly on their birds they also use their
ponytails.
Wolowitz: What's your point?
Raj: My point is that if I was a bird or a horse I'd be very nervous
around James Cameron.
%
Sheldon: Why did the chicken cross the Möbius strip? To get to the same
side, bazinga!!!
%
Sheldon: Now to the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark
side of the moon. Now here's Uranus!
%
Penny: I love where you skip over the part where no one asks.
%
Howard: The one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed
was an ego boost.
%
Rajesh:So in Avatar, they have sex on Pandora by linking their ponytails.
So their ponytails...are like their junk.
Wolowitz:Yeah, so.
Rajesh: Well when they ride the horses and birds they link their
ponytails, too.
Wolowitz: What's your point?
Rajesh: My point is, if I were a horse or a bird I'd be really nervous
around James Cameron.
%
Shedlon: People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me; if the
children can't, leave them behind! Ohhh, the simulated horror!
%
Howard: Raj says he can teach you... what do call it? (Raj repeats it to
him again.) Uh, I don't know some Indian meditation crap.
%
Sheldon: I see, I assume since the rest of you have set the bar so low,
you're saving the most impressive contribution for last, go on Howard,
dazzle me.
Howard: Well, my power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about
your piddly-ass problem. And that's 24/7 buddy.
%
Sheldon: Now for all the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the
dark side of the moon. *A pause. The camera cuts to the dinner guests* And
here's Uranus.
%
Sheldon: I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around
me was to scale so it all looked normal.
Leonard: Well, how did you know you were a giant if everything was to
scale?
Sheldon: I was wearing size a million pants.
%
Raj: You own the damn thing, just take a freaking sweater.
Sheldon: I didn't turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the
shelves willy-nilly.
%
Bernadette: That's a bit sad.
%
Levar Burton: *Walks through the apartment door and stares in horror at
the Kripke, Zach and Stuart singing*
Hello I c... Oh no, uh huh ... *Slams door shut* ... I am so done with
Twitter.
%
Wolowitz: Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got
punched by Bill Gates?
Priya: Oh, God, you're kidding.
Raj: No, Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him
afterwards and said, "Maybe if you weren't so distracted by sick children
in Africa you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista."
%
Leonard: Hey, I thought you were with your new buddies.
Sheldon: I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
%
Bernadette: We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time.
Maybe go dancing?
Penny: Oh, gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.
Amy: You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the
rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving
from the fiery jewel of Mumbai?
%
Sheldon: We could also stop using the letter M. But I think that idea is
isguided and oronic.
%
Sheldon: How wonderful, dinner with some assembly required.
%
Sheldon: At one point Raj put on reggae music and his sister took off her
shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.
%
Amy (to Penny): You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing
over the rich variety of sweet loving your ex-boyfriend is currently
receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai?
%
Amy: (To Bernadette) If you'd have let me bring the chloroform, we
wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber!
%
Amy: Y'know, if being on your own is new to you, I'd be happy to share
some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I've perfected over the
years. For example, do you own an electric toothbrush?
Penny: No
Amy: You should get one!
%
Sheldon: (knocking) All my friends. (knocking) All my friends. (knocking)
All my friends.
Howard: Wow, I think it's like Beetlejuice. We must've said his name too
many times.
%
*After complaining of dead pixels on Raj's TV
Sheldon: Oh look, it's Harry Potter and 98% of Sorcerer's stone!
%
Sheldon: We had a good run, You and I!
%
Zack: (Introducing himself) I'm Zack and I'm, uh... could you come back to
me.
%
Kripke: I'm Barry Kripke and I'm here because you told me there was a
raffle. Where is the raffle?
Sheldon: Patience, patience, Barry, the waffle-- ahem. The raffle... is
the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.
Kripke: One more question--
Sheldon: Yes, you must be present to win.
%
Amy: (To Penny) Yo, P-Dawg!
%
Zack: Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go to the lodge and get in
the Jacuzzi. There's no one around, so naturally I'm free-balling it. Next
thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up. Drunk out of her skull, wants
to get in with me.
Sheldon: Question: was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
Kripke: Really, that's your question?
Zack:What's the difference?
%
Sheldon: Jacuzzi is a commercial brand, hot tub is the generic term, i.e.,
all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.
Zack: Is that like all thumbs are fingers but not all fingers are thumbs?
Sheldon: Surprisingly, yes!
Zack: Nice! Now what exactly are toes?
%
Stuart: Can you please get back to the drunk girl, I'd like something to
think about in the shower.
Zack: Oh, yeah, right. Anyway, she takes off all her clothes, climbs in
the hot tub, and the first thing I noticed--
Sheldon: The water level rose.
%
Sheldon: When he (Archimedes) finished, he shouted "Eureka"!
Zack: No, I always shouted, "Holy, moly!" Don't know why, just do.
%
Amy: Do you have an electric toothbrush?
Penny: Um, no!
Amy: You should get one.
%
Sheldon: (Knocking) All my friends! (knocking) All my friends! (knocking)
All my friends!
%
Priya: Would you like some homemade chili?
Sheldon: Are there beans in it?
Priya: Yes!
Sheldon: Then it's not chili. Real chili has no beans in it. But you're
from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.
%
Sheldon: (Eating the chili) Mmm, this is good. Whatever this is.
%
Sheldon:He'll be back.
Leonard: (Through the door) Of course, I'll be back, I live here!
%
Sheldon: (Waving Zork game) Pick me, pick me, I'm fun.
Kripke: (Referring to Sheldon's Atari games) That all sucks the big hairy
meatball.
%
Sheldon: The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
%
Raj: I was so smooth on that date.
Howard: Dude, I made you smooth, you were an idiot.
%
Penny: This girl is trouble! What kind of relationship is it where you buy
her gifts and she gives you sex?
Raj: The best one I've ever had!
%
Raj: She gives me things, too.
Raj's father: Yeah, yeah, I'm a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she
gives you.
%
Raj: I don't know if I wanna play any more.
Sheldon: Because you don't have a girlfriend? Well, good lord. If that
becomes a reason to not play dungeons and dragons, this game is in serious
trouble.
%
Penny: (Whispers) Here she comes.
Howard: Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick doesn't hear you!
%
(The guys are playing Dungeons & Dragons, with Sheldon as GM.)
Sheldon: The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to
open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling,
moss-covered ogre. What do you do?
Howard: I say, "Hey Ma, what's for dinner?"
%
Sheldon: Good night. And if there's an apocalypse, good luck.
%
Sheldon: *While peeing* Pee for Houston, pee for Austin.
Pee for the state my heart got lost in.
And shake twice for Texas.
%
Howard: I have a two-part question.
Sheldon: Go ahead.
Howard: A: Are you kidding? And B: Seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
Sheldon: A: I rarely kid, and B: when I do kid, you will know it by my use
of the word "bazinga".
Howard: So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the
same bed?
Sheldon: Yes. (pause) Bazinga.
%
Dr. Plimpton: Can I ask you a question Howard? Do you like role-playing
games?
Howard: Yeah, sure. In fact I'm a dungeon master.
%
Dr. Plimpton: Tonight, you are the delivery man, you brought soup, and
uh-oh! Raj and I don't have enough money to pay you! So we'll have to come
to some other kind of arrangement...?
Howard: Beg your pardon?
Dr. Plimpton: You two figure out the details; I'm gonna change into
something I don't mind getting ripped off my milky flesh! (goes off to
change)
Howard: What the frack?
Raj: Go away! She wants New Delhi, not kosher deli! Besides, you have a
girlfriend!
Howard: Yeah, we broke up weeks ago!
Raj: What-? Why didn't you say anything?!
Howard: I was waiting for the right time; this is a right time!
%
Raj: Okay, show of hands: who's up for this?
(Howard eagerly raises his hand)
Leonard: We'll all be naked - in front of each other.
Howard (lowering his hand): I'm out.
%
Raj: I don't wanna sit by myself!
Sheldon: That's what Typhoid Mary said and clearly, her friends buckled.
%
Howard: Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
Sheldon: Sarcasm?
Howard: Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.
%
Howard: So you're telling the two of you will be sleeping in the same bed
together?
Sheldon: Yes.
*Pause*
Sheldon: Bazinga!
%
Leonard: Do you think we can outrun him?
Sheldon: I don't need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.
%
Sheldon: I'm not going to say I told you so... But we could have killed
him.
%
Penny: Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
Leonard: Yeah, it's "Penny already eats our food she can pay for Wi-Fi".
No spaces.
%
Sheldon: I platonically love you, man, but you're a mess.
%
Sheldon: I don't watch you 24-hours a day. I don't know what you do.
%
Sheldon: You are soft. The world is going to chew you then spit you out.
%
*After Jimmy Speckerman comments on how close he and Leonard were in
highschool*
Wolowitz: Yeah, like the Black Death and Europe.
%
Sheldon: For what it's worth, my mother says that when we deceive for
personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
%
Leonard: Here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space
Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so
the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
Raj: You mean so it doesn't hit the fan?
%
Howard: Hey, you want to make sure [Stuart] gets nowhere with Penny
without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
Leonard: I'm listening.
Howard: Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last
two years.
%
Sheldon: Yeah, I have to say I thought the toilet humor would get less
funny with repetition. Apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic
returns with space poop.
%
Leonard: Thanks for close captioning my pain, Raj.
%
*Talking about the Wolowitz's zero gravity waste disposal system (space
toilet)*
Howard: Okay make your little jokes, but out of the 4 of us, I'm the only
one who's making real world contribution to science and technology.
Rajesh: He's right, this is an important achievement for 2 reasons. Number
one ... and of course number two!
%
Stuart: Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It's
mind-blowing.
Sheldon: Excuse me. Spoiler alert.
Stuart: I didn't spoil anything.
Sheldon: You told me it's mind-blowing.So, my mind is going into it
pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
Stuart: I'm sorry.
Sheldon: Said the Grinch to Christmas.
%
Howard: Ok, now, this is an exact duplicate of The Wolowitz Solid Waste
Disposal System, as deployed on the International Space Station.
Raj: Don't you mean the Wolowitz Solid Waste DISTRIBUTION system?
%
Sheldon: Why does Leonard get to go?
Wolowitz: Because he's upset over his situation with Penny, and if I have
to hear about it again, I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries!
Leonard: Thanks for understanding.
Howard: I've got your back, sister!
%
Sheldon: Hey, Stuart, have you read the new Flash?
Stuart: No!
Sheldon: Well I have and it will knock your socks off. Good luck getting
them back on.
%
Sheldon: 1234 is not a secure password.
%
Store Clerk: You don't work here.
Sheldon: Well aparently no one does.
%
Sheldon: What type of Computer do you have? And please don't say a white
one.
%
[Sheldon is refusing to buy a present for Leonard]
Howard: [to Penny] Try telling him it's a non optional social convention.
Penny: What?
Howard: Just do it!
Penny: [to Sheldon] It's a non optional social convention.
Sheldon: Oh! Fair enough.
[Penny surprised]
Howard: He came with a manual.
%
Sheldon: Hello, Penny! Leonard just left.
Penny: I know. I wanna talk to you.
Sheldon: What would WE talk about? We have no overlapping areas of
interest, as I'm aware of. And you know I don't care for chit-chat.
Penny: Can you just let me in?
Sheldon: Well, OK but I don't see this is a promising endeavor.
%
Leonard: My parents focused on celebrating achievements and being expelled
from a birth canal was not considered one of them.
%
Howard: Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
Penny: What?
Howard: Just do it!
Penny: *To Sheldon* It's a non-optional social convention.
Sheldon: Ah, fair enough.
Howard: He came with a manual.
%
Store Clerk: Excuse me Sir, you don't work here
Sheldon: Yes, well apparently neither does anyone else
%
Penny: That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Howard: (to Leonard) Go ahead. Tell her about your senior prom.
%
Leonard: Howard, every Thai rstraunt in town knows you can't eat peanuts.
When they see me coming they say, 'Ah! No peanut boy!'
%
Sheldon: The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense. Let's say
that I go out and I spend 50 dollars on you. It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need whereas you know what you need.
Now I could simplify things, just give you the 50 dollars directly and
then you could give me 50 dollars on my birthday and so on; until one of
us dies leaving the other one old and 50 dollar richer and I ask you is,
it worth it?
%
Howard: (Talking to his scrotum) I'm doing this for you, Little Buddy.
(Eats Granola Bar)
%
Sheldon: Penny, if I'm going to get Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it
right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.
Penny: I know I'm gonna regret this, but what trauma?
Sheldon: On my 12th birthday, I really wanted a titanium centrifuge so,
you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.
Penny: Of course, yeah.
Sheldon: Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me-- Wow,
this is hard. They got me a motorized dirt bike.
Penny: (Sarcarstic) No!
Sheldon: What 12-year-old boy wants a motorized dirt bike?
Penny: All of them!
%
Howard: Okay, I get it, I know how the world works. How about if I were to
introduce you to the man who freed your people? (laying down a $5 bill)
Althea: Unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his 5 twin
brothers, you are wasting your time.
%
Penny: You keep him (Leonard) there a little longer, and when you get to
the party, I'll point out which of my friends are easy.
(There's a huge pause)
Howard: Don't toy with me, woman.
Penny: I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I got a girl who
punishes her father by sleeping around, and an alcoholic who's 2 tequila
shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.
Howard: Thy will be done.
%
Sheldon: She calls me moon-pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could eat
me up!
%
Penny: Whassup Moonpie?
%
Penny: Hey Leonard, what's up with Dr Wackadoodle?
%
Well, it seems once again you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.
%
Penny: (On the phone) We're putting the play on for one night in this
little 99-seat theater. Can you come?
Oh great! Do you know 98 other people that might want to come?
%
Sheldon: No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw.
%
Leonard: We had a vote. 3 of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for
train, so we're taking the train.
Sheldon: Don't say it like that, Leonard. Say it like, "We're taking the
train!"
%
Howard: It's hot in here, it must be Summer.
%
Sheldon: Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get
here soon enough.
%
Penny: Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.
Sheldon: That's the wrong box. Put it back.
Penny: Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?
Sheldon: Don't read those letters.
Penny: Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
Sheldon: (shrieking) Put down the letters!
%
Leonard: Well, it looks like your caught between a rock and a crazy place.
Sheldon: I hate when that happens.
%
Howard: You know the old saying: pasty and frail never fail.
%
Raj: I hate myself, but I'm pretty sure I'm mad at you!
%
Sheldon: You're misusing the word 'ho'. It's an interjection used to call
attention to a destination, not an object, as in 'land ho' or 'westward
ho'.
%
Sheldon: Oh yes, canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats,
however, refuse to wear sporting apparel.
%
Howard: Sheldon knows football? I mean Quidditch, sure, but football?
%
Sheldon: I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro
football, college football, high school football, pee wee football... in
fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which
most Texans believe to be a commie plot.
%
Penny: Here, have some pizza, sweetie.
Leonard: You know I'm lactose intolerant.
Penny: I know; I just need you to stop talking.
%
Sheldon: That seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for
intercourse. Don't you have access to women who will do it for money?
%
Leonard: I think I'm starting to get this.
Rajesh: Really? The only thing I've learnt in the last 2 hours is that
American men drink a lot of beer, pee too often and have trouble getting
erections.
Leonard: Focus on the game, not the commercials Raj.
%
Wolowitz: At least I can talk to women without being drunk.
Rajesh: Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognised medical disorder.
You're just a douche.
%
Sheldon: If you want to blend in with Penny%u2019s friends, I'd think
looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
%
Raj: You always do this, you know, ditch me for a woman you don't have a
shot with.
Howard: I totally had a shot.
Raj: With a woman you were chasing in a park. That's not a Shot, that's a
Felony.
%
Sheldon: What's funny about Cylon Toast?
%
Leonard: The robot hand got stuck on your what?
%
Raj: You slipped and fell into a robotic hand..
Wolowitz: Yes.
Raj: Penis first?
Wolowitz: Yes.
%
Sheldon: I have a Masters degree and two Doctorates. The things I *should*
know, I do know.
%
Sheldon: Is your womb available for rental?
%
Sheldon: Well that's no threat, my mother's always wanted a grandchild.
Penny: Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a
test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
Sheldon: Curses!
%
Sheldon: I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
%
Sheldon: So, this conversation is as pointless as your door knocking
soliloquy?
Penny: Let me get my cockamimi keys.
%
Raj: When Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his
friends all graped onto him and pull and pull.
*Wolowitz is in dire pain*
Leonard: You do what you want I'm not touching another man's honey tree.
%
Nurse: *Lifts up towel* What is this?
Howard: It's a robot arm.
Nurse: Where's the rest of the robot?
Howard: I only built the arm.
Nurse: Because that's all you needed, right?
%
Wolowitz: *After the robot hand lets go* Winnie the Pooh is out of the
honey tree!
%
Sheldon: I am aware of the way humans usually reproduce which is messy,
unsanitary and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud
and unnecessary appeals to a deity.
Penny: Oh, God.
Sheldon: Yes, exactly.
%
Leonard: What do you mean it happened again?!
%
Rajesh: You know there's something I've always wondered about Aquaman
Leonard: Yeah?
Rajesh: Where does he poop?
Leonard: What?
Rajesh: What do the toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it?
And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?
%
Penny: Anybody want to buy a pair of my panties for $1,400?
%
Leonard: I'd suggest using some lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell
on that as well. *He and Raj snicker*
Howard: Not funny, Leonard!
Raj: Oh, come on, dude. A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk. It's
funny, ask anyone.
%
Howard's mom: Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!
Howard: That's great, mom! Thanks!
Howard's mom: I'll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!
Howard: *startled* Don't come up here!...
Howard's mom: Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?
Howard: Yes, but that's not the point! (to Leonard and Raj) Get me out of
here!
Leonard: Do you have any ideas, Raj?
Raj: Right now all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.
%
Sheldon: I decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date
with Amy Farrah Fowler.
Penny: Oh, that's great! Have fun.
Sheldon: Wait! You have to drive me.
Penny: What?!
Sheldon: You know I don't drive.
Penny: Well, go ask Leonard!
Sheldon: I did; he said, and I quote: "Ask Penny, it was her cockamamie
idea."
Penny: Leonard said "cockamamie"?
Sheldon: Actually, I'm paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian
household, I'm uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest,
I'm not entirely comfortable with "cockamamie".
%
Penny: Can I ask you a question?
Sheldon: Given your community-college education, I encourage you to ask me
as many as possible.
Penny: ...yeah. Well, my question is - and I'm pretty sure I know the
answer - is this your first date?
Sheldon: That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for
Jesus 4th of July Hoedown count as a date?
Penny: No.
Sheldon: Then this is my first date.
%
Amy Farrah Fowler (text message): I don't care for perchloroethylene, and
I don't like glycol ether.
%
Penny: Sheldon, have you ever told Amy what it was like for you growing up
in Texas?
Sheldon: No.
Penny: Well, why don't you tell her?
Sheldon: All right! (to Amy) It was hell!
%
Raj: How about we get an electric saw and cut it (The robot hand that's
trapped Howard's penis) off?
Howard: What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
%
Sheldon: Impressive, but we must be cautious.
Howard: Why?
Sheldon: Today, it's a Chinese-food-retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels
back in time and kills Sarah Connor.
%
Penny: (To the robot arm) That's amazing.
Sheldon: I wouldn't say amazing. At best it's a modest leap forward from
the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.
Howard: Hey, Sheldon? Ahem.
Sheldon: Yes?
*Howard commands the robot arm to flash the piece sign.*
Sheldon: Peace?
Howard: No, not peace. Hang on.
%
Penny: Can I ask you a question?
Sheldon: Given your community-college education, I encourage you to ask me
as many as possible.
%
Sheldon Cooper: You're my 15th favorite technological visionary.
Steve Wozniak: Only 15th?
Sheldon Cooper: It's still 6 spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for
turtlenecks nor showmanship.
Steve Wozniak: Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.
Sheldon Cooper: One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple.
Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty
nifty little achievement.
Steve Wozniak: Thanks. We were shooting for nifty. You know if you had it
here I'd autograph it for you.
Sheldon Cooper: Don't move for 15 to 30 minutes depending on how the buses
are running.
Steve Wozniak: (To his wife) Nerds!
%
Howard: For all we know Lucinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman. She
could have been a fifty year old truck driver from New Jersey.
%
Raj: Oh, you're so arrogant! If you were a super hero your name would be
Captain Arrogant. And do you know what your super power would be?
Arrogance!
%
Sheldon: Oh, Penny! Penny!
Penny: What's up?
Sheldon: Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
%
Leonard: Oh my god! You ran over a hobo!
%
Leonard: (To Sheldon) Sometimes your movements are so life like I forget
you are not a real boy.
%
*Raj walking out of Sheldon's office after he's almost blown himself up*
Raj: This is not over!
%
Sheldon: You're wrong again. If arrogance were my super power, my name
would be Dr. Arroganto.
%
Bernadette: What's George Takei doing here?
Katie Sackhoff: Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?
Howard: Of course not.
George Takei: So you say, yet here I am.
%
Mrs. Wolowitz: Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!
Howard: Great, Ma!
Mrs. Wolowitz: I think it shrunk! I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury
Doughboy here.
Howard: And with that mental picture, I think we're done for the evening.
%
Raj: Sorry, dude. The thermostat's on my side of the room, so it stays
Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!
Sheldon: I'll turn off the music when you get rid of that
salmonella-ridden parakeet.
Raj: Oh, too bad. Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds. Hey, look,
Sheldon. Birdie, birdie, birdie.
Sheldon: That's it. Prepare for marshmallow death.
Raj: Eat flaming Nerf!
%
Sheldon (to Wolowitz): You'd hit particulate soil on a colloidal
suspension.
Sheldon: (elaborates after seeing Howard's confusion) Mud.
%
Sheldon: DANGER! DANGER!
%
Wolowitz: It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz.
%
Sheldon: I'm surprised you struck out with Penny, apparently she's a big
'ol five.
%
Raj: What's with him? *Pointing at Sheldon sleeping*.
Leonard: Penny is keeping him up at night.
Howard: Me too! But probably in a different way.
%
Dr. Gablehauser: What colorful nickname did you call Dr. Cooper this time?
Leslie: Dr. Dumbass.
%
Leslie: Hello men. Sheldon.
%
Dr.Gablehauser: Need to get that, Dr. Cooper?
Sheldon: God, no.
Leslie: Don't turn it off, you might miss the Nobel Prize Committee saying
that you won "Dumbass Scientist of the Year."
%
Leonard: Wanna catch me up?
Sheldon: Well, uh, let's see, she attempted to open her apartment with her
car key because her faces is overly Midwestern. Uh, she hasn't had sex in
6 months, and she ate a fly.
Leonard: Uh-huh! Seriously, 6 months.
%
Sheldon: Level 3 and she think she's rich. What a noob!
%
Sheldon: Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to
enter Atzel's fortress. Now, this is a long run, so let's do another
bladder check. All right, Barry, we'll wait for you again, but you really
should see a doctor.
%
Sheldon: Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.
%
Sheldon: You're in my bedroom.
Penny: Yeah, Leonard gave me an emergency key.
Sheldon: People can't be in my bedroom.
%
Penny: Can we go talk in the living room?
Sheldon: I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.
Penny: Why not?
Sheldon: I spilled grape juice.
Penny: Well, wear different pajamas.
Sheldon: I can't wear different pajamas. These are my Monday pajamas.
%
Tom: I'm sorry, dude, she (Penny) didn't look anything like her picture.
Leonard: They never do.
%
%
Wolowitz: I am a horny engineer, I never joke about math or sex.
%
Howard [to Leonard]: Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
Sheldon: The one that estimates the odds of making contact with
extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly
restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets,
and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE
times FL times FI times FC times L?
[pause]
Howard: Yeah, that one.
%
Penny: Um, you know it's kinda early. Do you wanna maybe come in for some
coffee or something?
Stuart: Oh gee, its a little late for coffee isn't it?
Penny: Aw, you think coffee means coffee. That is so sweet.
%
Raj: Come on! You know I can't talk to women unless I'm lit up like the
Hindu festival of Diwali!
%
Sheldon: Amazing Spiderman, Ultimate Spiderman, Spectacular Spiderman, the
Marvelous Adventures of Spiderman, Spiderman 2099?
Penny: Leonard?
Leonard: You know this can go on all night. Why don't you just come with
us?
Penny: Ugh, that's what I was trying to avoid.
Sheldon: Oh, I forgot, Sensational Spiderman.
%
Penny: What would you recommend a present for a 13-year-old boy?
Stuart: A 13-year-old girl!
%
Howard: I have got to learn how to draw!
%
Sheldon: Chinese Food, Vintage video games. After the nightmare of
Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to
be.
Howard: Who's up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
%
Sheldon: Howard?
Howard: Yeah?
Sheldon: Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
Howard: What?
Sheldon: Bazinga, I don't care.
%
Sheldon: Why are you crying?
Penny: Because I'm stupid!
Sheldon: That's no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For
example, I cry because others are stupid, and that makes me sad.
%
Sheldon: Mom was right - hell is real!
%
Leonard: Howard, relax. I am not interested in your girlfriend.
Howard: I hope not. Because you don't wanna mess with me. *Gets in
Leonard's face* I'm crazy.
%
Howard: Hope you don't mind, I told my girlfriend, Bernadette, she can
join us for dinner.
Leonard: Sure, the more the merrier.
Sheldon: Wait, no. That's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry.
If there was 2000 people in this apartment right now, would we be
celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.
%
Penny: Look, can we just forget about this extra stuff and can you just
tell me what Leonard does?
Sheldon: Alright. Leonard is attempting to learn why subatomic particles
move the way they do.
Penny: Really? That's it? Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.
Sheldon: It's not... it's why Leonard does it.
%
Leonard's Mom: Did I thank you for the flowers?
Sheldon: You did.
Leonard's Mom: I don't really like flowers.
Sheldon: Neither do I, but it's the social convention.
Leonard's Mom: It is.
%
Howard: Bernadette say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.
%
Leonard: (To penny) It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
%
Howard: Wazzup, my nerdizzles?
%
Sheldon: No, fig newtons are named after the town in Massachusetts, not
the scientist. Hey, don't write that down.
%
Raj: Ha-ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.
Sheldon: That's not fair! I got stuck behind a tree.
Raj: And a cow, and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it's a real car or a
virtual car, you can't drive.
Sheldon: Just need a little more practice.
Raj: What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a genie who grants
wishes to little boys who sucks at "MarioKart."
%
Sheldon: (Insulting Penny) Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Penny: Hey, you don't have to be so mean.
Sheldon: Oh, I'm sorry, (smiling) have you suffered a recent blow to the
head?
%
Sheldon: Koko learned to understands over 2000 words, not one of which had
anything to do with shoes.
%
Bernadette: This isn't a nonfat yogurt, this is fatty-fat-fat!
%
Howard: (To Leonard angrily) It's not enough you get the prom queen
(Penny), you have to get the head of the decorating committee(Bernadette),
too?
%
Howard: Just giving the lady the old tour of the salt mines.
Bernadette: (Giggling) He doesn't mean salt mines , he means where he
works.
%
Howard: You don't wanna mess with me. (Getting in Leonard's face) I'm
crazy!
Leonard: (Annoyed) I believe you!
%
Penny: I have to go to the bathroom.
Sheldon: Can't you hold it?
Penny: Not for 2600 years!
%
Howard: (To Bernadette) Come on, I don't wanna eat lamb stew with my
mother. (To himself) Damn, was this close to the bra.
%
Sheldon: (Typing) Research Journal, Entry One. I'm about to embark on one
of the great challenges of my scientific career: teaching Penny physics!
I'm calling it "Project Gorilla"!
%
Sheldon: Where's your notebook?
Penny: Um, I don't have one.
Sheldon: How are you gonna take notes without a notebook?
Penny: I have to take notes?
Sheldon: How else are you gonna study for the tests?
Penny: There's gonna be a test?
Sheldon: Correcting Penny) Tests!
%
Penny: Hay Leonard, check this out. * Throws won-ton in the air and
catches it in her mouth *
Sheldon: Leonard, she's doing it again.
Leonard: I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
Sheldon: No, it upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the
containers with out guard of equitable distribution. * Turns to Raj * This
is essentially why you have famine in India.
